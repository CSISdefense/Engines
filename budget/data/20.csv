It provides the only source of critical developmental engineering support for the F135 propulsion system.  F135 CIP maintains flight safety (highest priority), corrects service revealed deficiencies, improves system Operational Readiness (OR) and Reliability & Maintainability (R&M), reduces propulsion system Life Cycle Cost (LCC), and sustains the propulsion system throughout its service life. Historically, aircraft systems change missions, tactics, and environment (including new fuels) and meet changing threats throughout their lives.  New technical problems can develop in the propulsion system through actual use and the F135 CIP provides the means to develop fixes for these problems.  F135 CIP funding is driven by field events and type/maturity of the propulsion system, not by the total quantity of engines.  The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the propulsion system's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older engines operational.  F135 CIP, through ""Lead the Fleet"" operational use and accelerated mission testing, identifies and fixes propulsion-related problems ahead of operational impacts.

226,Project,0205633N,1355,Propulsion and Power Component Improvement Program,7,"The Propulsion and Power (P&P) Component Improvement Program (CIP) provides the only source of critical design and development engineering support to resolve safety, reliability  and maintainability deficiencies of in-service Navy and Marine Corps aircraft propulsion systems. The highest priority issues P&P CIP addresses concern safety-of-flight deficiencies, which account for approximately 80% of P&P CIP efforts. The program also corrects service-revealed deficiencies, improves Operational Readiness and Reliability and Maintainability, and reduces platform Life Cycle Cost. Budgets are allocated across platform-specific teams and multi-platform product support teams based upon long term strategies to achieve  safety and affordable readiness goals; the R-3 exhibit details annual portions of those long-term strategies. P&P CIP tasks have reduced the rate of in-flight aborts, safety incidents, non-mission capable rates, scheduled and unscheduled engine removals, maintenance work hours, and overall cost of ownership. This is accomplished through the maintenance and validation of specification performance, testing to qualify engineering changes, verifying life limits, and improving the inherent reliability of the propulsion and power systems as an integral part of Reliability Centered Maintenance initiatives. Historically, the missions, tactics, and environmental exposure of military aircraft systems change to meet new threats or operational demands, and often result in unforeseen problems, which if not corrected, can cause critical safety/readiness degradation, such as those experienced during OPERATIONS DESERT SHIELD/DESERT STORM, ENDURING FREEDOM, and IRAQI FREEDOM due to sand erosion. In addition, new problems arise through actual fleet deployment and usage of the aircraft. System development programs, while geared to resolve as many problems as possible before deployment, cannot duplicate actual operations or account for the vast array of environmental and usage variables, particularly when aircraft missions vary from those that the aircraft was designed to perform. Therefore, it has been found that P&P CIP can provide an immediate engineering response to these flight-critical problems and accelerated engine testing can avoid potential problems. P&P CIP starts after development and Navy acceptance of the first production article and addresses usage and life problems not covered by warranties. P&P CIP addresses engines, transmissions, propellers, starters, auxiliary power units, electrical generating systems, aircraft wiring, and fuel and lubricant systems. These efforts continue over the system's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level sufficient to maintain the reliability, and decrease the operating costs, of older inventory.

The Improved Turbine Engine (ITE) replaces the existing T700 engine design originated in the 1970's and meets the operational requirement of 6,000 feet pressure altitude and 95 degrees (6K/95).  The ITE will fit inside the existing engine bays of the Black Hawk and Apache Helicopters and provides a significant power enhancement of up to fifty percent (total of 3,000 class shaft horsepower) with increased fuel efficiency.  Additional benefits include improved design life, enhanced reliability, lower maintenance cost and restored capability lost due to aircraft weight growth, without increasing the logistics footprint.  The program consists of systems engineering and program management, detailed design engineering, design assurance, hardware manufacturing and testing, component and module level development and testing, system level testing and qualification, as well as integration into the airframe.  FY 2019 funds the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract that will be awarded to one vendor, platform/engine integration design engineering, and ballistic assessments ending in FY 2020. FY 2020 funding continues both the EMD effort and platform/engine integration A-kit development, resulting in a Critical Design Review (CDR). Engine component testing will begin, and engine fit check will be performed for both platforms. FY 2021 continues the EMD effort, continues A-Kit component testing, begins Preliminary Flight Rating (PFR) testing leading to First Engine To Test (FETT). FY 2021 also begins physical airframe integration. FY 2022 funding will continue PFR testing, leading to a Flight Test Air Worthiness Release (AWR) in early FY 2023. FY 2023 funding provides for aircraft flight/qualification testing for both Apache and Black Hawk and the initiation of engine full qualification testing. FY 2024 funding provides for completion of engine qualification, completion of aircraft flight/qualification testing for both Apache and Black Hawk, and Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP).",0.000,167.532,188.903,206.434,0.000,206.434,279.600,217.900,166.400,165.662,Improved Turbine Engine Program,Army,
