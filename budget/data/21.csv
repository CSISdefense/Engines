The highest priority issues P&P CIP addresses concern safety-of-flight deficiencies, which account for approximately 80% of P&P CIP efforts. The program also corrects service-revealed deficiencies, improves Operational Readiness and Reliability and Maintainability, and reduces platform Life Cycle Cost. Budgets are allocated across platform-specific teams and multi-platform product support teams based upon long term strategies to achieve  safety and affordable readiness goals; the R-3 exhibit details annual portions of those long-term strategies. P&P CIP tasks have reduced the rate of in-flight aborts, safety incidents, non-mission capable rates, scheduled and unscheduled engine removals, maintenance work hours, and overall cost of ownership. This is accomplished through the maintenance and validation of specification performance, testing to qualify engineering changes, verifying life limits, and improving the inherent reliability of the propulsion and power systems as an integral part of Reliability Centered Maintenance initiatives. Historically, the missions, tactics, and environmental exposure of military aircraft systems change to meet new threats or operational demands, and often result in unforeseen problems, which if not corrected, can cause critical safety/readiness degradation, such as those experienced during OPERATIONS DESERT SHIELD/DESERT STORM, ENDURING FREEDOM, and IRAQI FREEDOM due to sand erosion. In addition, new problems arise through actual fleet deployment and usage of the aircraft. System development programs, while geared to resolve as many problems as possible before deployment, cannot duplicate actual operations or account for the vast array of environmental and usage variables, particularly when aircraft missions vary from those that the aircraft was designed to perform. Therefore, it has been found that P&P CIP can provide an immediate engineering response to these flight-critical problems and accelerated engine testing can avoid potential problems.

P&P CIP addresses engines, transmissions, propellers, starters, auxiliary power units, electrical generating systems, aircraft wiring, and fuel and lubricant systems.

J-series, K-series, Tactical Targeting Network Technology, and other emerging datalink technology messages, as well as compliance with crypto modernization requirements and ability to use GPS-modernized weapons, are required to support current and future mission threats. Linked performance on par with current tactical platforms as well as design to communicate with F-35 is required for the AV-8B to remain tactically relevant to transition. H7.0 will also include the integration and test of weapons and sensors such as, but not limited to, AIM-9X, JSOW and Litening OFP V4, and will integrate required Display Computer processing improvements to enable H7.0 functionality.

Additionally, software integration and stores expansion testing will be required for systems to include a Helmet Mounted Cueing System (HMCS), Unique Weapons, survivability and Countermeasures, Advanced Precision Kill Weapons System (APKWS), AIM-9X, ALE-43, survivability upgrades, standoff weapons such as JSOW, Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM) and AIM-120 unique platform flight test which will be required to utilize updated AIM-120C variants on the AV-8B as well as test of emergent tactical requirements, and test of crypto modernization compliance. AV-8B funding also supports peculiar flight test requirements to include weapons integration/carriage and avionics, software/firmware upgrades, and avionics hardware component redesign activity. Studies and analyses will be conducted on systems such as survivability systems, HMCS and Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) to assess feasibility of integrating on the AV-8B. The ELMP is a comprehensive plan to increase and maintain safety of flight and operational readiness of the AV-8B F402-RR-408 Engine and accessories.  The program will accomplish this mission by conducting Engineering Project Description investigations to develop engineering solutions that address emergent safety, obsolescence, foreign object debris detection and prevention, fatigue life and maintenance issues.  The OR/RMP is required to ensure the AV-8B air vehicle's sustained mission availability, and safe and reliable operational readiness until end of service.

The V-22 program is designed to provide an aircraft to meet the amphibious/vertical assault needs of the Marine Corps, the Carrier Onboard Delivery (COD) needs of the Navy, and the special operations needs of the Air Force and the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). The MV-22 variant is replacing the CH-46E in the Marine Corps and the CMV-22 will replace the C-2A in the Navy. The CV-22 variant replaced the MH-53J and MH-53M and augments the C-130 in the Air Force and USSOCOM.  The V-22 is capable of flying over 2,100 nautical miles, with a single refueling, giving the services the advantage of a Vertical/Short Take-off and Landing aircraft that can rapidly self-deploy to any location in the world.  This program is funded under Engineering Manufacturing and Development for correction of deficiencies and includes Block A and Block B upgrades which encompassed engineering and manufacturing development of new end-items prior to the production incorporation decision as well as Block C suitability and effectiveness development upgrades.

This PE fosters innovation in Army niche areas (e.g., lightweight armor, energetic materials, and night vision capability) and areas where there is no commercial investment due to limited markets (e.g., vaccines for tropical diseases). It also focuses university single investigator research on areas of high interest to the Army (e.g., high-density compact power and novel sensor phenomenology). The in-house portion of the program capitalizes on the Army's scientific talent and specialized facilities to transition knowledge and technology into appropriate developmental activities. The extramural program leverages the research efforts of other government agencies, academia, and industry.  This PE also supports basic research at the Army laboratories through the In-House Laboratory Independent Research (ILIR) program.  The ILIR program serves as a catalyst for major technology breakthroughs by providing laboratory directors flexibility in implementing novel research ideas, by nurturing promising young scientists and engineers, and is used to attract and retain top doctoral degreed scientists and engineers. The ILIR program also provides a source of competitive funds for peer reviewed efforts at Army laboratories to stimulate high quality, innovative research with significant opportunity for payoff to Army warfighting capability.

Problems addressed include the need for greater fuel efficiency and reduced weight in these propulsion systems.  Technical barriers to advanced propulsion systems are the inadequacy of existing materials to safely withstand higher temperature demands, the lack of capability to accurately simulate the flow physics and the mechanical behavior of these systems, including the engine and drive train.  The Army is the lead Service in these technology areas and performs basic research in propulsion, as applicable to rotorcraft as well as tracked and wheeled vehicles.  Technical solutions are being pursued through analysis, code generation, and evaluations to improve engine and drive train components and investigate advanced materials.
