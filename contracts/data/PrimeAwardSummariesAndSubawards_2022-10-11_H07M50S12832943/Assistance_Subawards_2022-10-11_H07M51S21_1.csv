SAMPLES TO BE TESTED, INCLUDING MATERIAL PROVIDED BY OEMS GE AVIATION AND ROLLS ROYCE, WILL BE MOUNTED IN A ROTATING CAROUSEL, ATOP A REFRACTORY PLUG THAT CAN BE CYCLICALLY INSERTED AND RETRACTED FROM THE EXPOSURE CHAMBER WITH AUTOMATED REMOVAL OF THE SAMPLE CAROUSEL FROM THE TEST CHAMBER (AND RE-INSERTION) FOR PROGRAMMED THERMAL CYCLING AND INSPECTION. THE SYSTEM DESIGN INCORPORATES RESISTIVE HEATERS TO MAINTAIN CONSTANT TEMPERATURE IN THE SAMPLE EXPOSURE CHAMBER OVER THE RANGE OF 900 - 2200°F (482 - 1204°C), SUCH THAT THE COMBUSTION PROCESS MAY BE MAINTAINED AT CONSTANT FLOW RATES   NOT ADJUSTED TO MAINTAIN OR CHANGE THERMAL CONDITIONS.

THE SEA SALT SOLUTIONS WILL BE PREPARED FROM A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE SYNTHETIC SEA SALT SATISFYING ASTM STANDARD D1141.
 THE MATERIALS TESTING CHAMBER ACCOMMODATES A ROTATING CAROUSEL WITH A 3"""" OUTER DIAMETER.

THE EXTENT OF THE SALT-INDUCED ATTACK WILL BE MONITORED BY MEASURING SURFACE LOSS, AND MAXIMUM PENETRATION AFTER TEST COMPLETION.  CORROSION PRODUCT COMPOSITION, PHASE AND MORPHOLOGY WILL BE CHARACTERIZED THROUGH SPECTROSCOPIC, OPTICAL AND ELECTRON MICROSCOPY TECHNIQUES.
 
 TWO TEST PROTOCOLS WILL BE ASSESSED WITH THE UC IRVINE LVBR (TEST PROTOCOL 1 WILL BE ASSESSED AT UVA): 
 TEST PROTOCOL 2:  THESE TESTS WILL BE CARRIED OUT AT 899°C (1650°F), AND WILL RUN FOR 1000 HOURS TO EVALUATE HIGH TEMPERATURE HOT CORROSION (HTHC) BEHAVIOR (TYPE I HOT CORROSION).  THE TESTS ARE RUN CONTINUOUSLY, WITH AN AUTOMATED THERMAL CYCLE EVERY 24 HOURS, WITH THE SAMPLE TAKEN OUT OF THE HOT ZONE, COOLED TO AMBIENT, AND RETURNED TO THE HOT ZONE OVER A 60 MINUTE PERIOD.
 TEST PROTOCOL 3:  THIS DEVELOPMENTAL TEST PROTOCOL IS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE MATERIALS DEGRADATION UNDER AGGRESSIVE MIXED OR CYCLIC CORROSION/OXIDATION CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIVE OF EMERGING OPERATIONAL PROFILES OF ADVANCED SHIPBOARD TURBINE SYSTEMS.   INITIALLY, THIS TEST PROTOCOL WILL BE BASED UPON A MULTI-STEP 24 HOUR CYCLE CONSISTING OF: (A) 7 HOURS AT LTHC CONDITIONS   704°C (1300°F), (B) 14 HOURS AT HTHC CONDITIONS   900°C (1650°F), (C) 1 HOUR AT OXIDATION CONDITIONS   982°C (1800°F), AND (D) A TWO HOUR CYCLE DURING WHICH THE SAMPLES ARE REMOVED FROM THE HOT ZONE, COOLED TO AMBIENT AND INSPECTED, AND RETURNED TO THE HOT ZONE FOR FURTHER TESTING.

IN ELECTRIC MOTORS  MAGNETIC MATERIALS ASSIST IN THE CONVERSION OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO MECHANICAL ENERGY. DURING THIS CONVERSION  ALTERNATING CURRENT ENERGY LOSSES OCCUR WHICH WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED THROUGH THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW CLASS OF (FE CO)-BASED AMORPHOUS AND NANOCRYSTALLINE MAGNETIC COMPOSITES. SUCH NEW MATERIALS WILL BE A KEY REQUIREMENT FOR NASA AS IT AIMS TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF ELECTRIC MOTORS THAT SCALE FROM THE KILOWATT TO MEGAWATT LEVELS AS OUTLINED IN NASA S NEXT GENERATION ELECTRICAL AND HYBRID AIRCRAFT TECHNICAL READINESS PLAN. TO PROVIDE A SYSTEMATIC DEVELOPMENT OF THESE ALLOYS  FACULTY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA (UA) WILL TEAM WITH GLENN RESEARCH CENTER (GRC) SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS TO CREATE A SYNERGISTIC PARTNERSHIP THAT LEVERAGES EXPERTISE AND INFRASTRUCTURE AT EACH INSTITUTION.

PROJECT PURPOSE: MOTIVATION AND INTEGRATION TO EMERGING NASA MISSIONS NEEDS.
 ELECTRIC BASED PROPULSION HAS EMERGED AS A STRATEGIC INVESTMENT FOR NASA S AERONAUTICS RESEARCH MISSION DIRECTORATE. IN JULY 2015, CHERYL BOWMAN, TECHNICAL LEAD FOR THE HYBRID GAS-ELECTRIC PROPULSION TEAM AT NASA S GLENN RESEARCH CENTER (GRC), GAVE AN OVERARCHING PROGRAM REVIEW WHERE SHE AND OTHERS OUTLINED NASA S CURRENT AND LONG-TERM TECHNOLOGY THRUSTS FOR ASSISTING OUR NATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ULTRA-EFFICIENT COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFTS. THIS NEW EFFORT WILL BE TO ASSIST THE NATION IN THE TRANSITION FROM PRIMARY FOSSIL FUEL TO LOW-CARBON PROPULSION TECHNOLOGIES USING SUCH OPTIONS AS TURBOELECTRICS WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE FUEL BURN AS COMPARED TO CURRENT AIRCRAFT. THESE GOALS INCLUDE A 2X INCREASE IN POWER DENSITY BY 2020, 5X INCREASE BY 2025, AND 10X INCREASE BY 2030+ FROM CURRENT POWER DENSITY LEVELS. THIS WILL TRANSLATE FROM KW TO MW HYBRID ELECTRIC PROPULSION MOTORS. A KEY CHALLENGE IN ACHIEVING THIS OBJECTIVE AS WELL AS AN ALL-ELECTRIC AIRCRAFT WILL BE THE NEED TO DEVELOP NEW AND ENABLING SOFT MAGNETIC ALLOYS. SOFT MAGNETIC ALLOYS LAY AT THE HEART OF DEVICES THAT CONVERT ELECTRICAL POWER FROM ONE FORM TO ANOTHER (TRANSFORMERS), FILTER OR DAMPEN ELECTRICAL CIRCUITS (INDUCTORS), AND CONVERT BETWEEN ELECTRICAL AND MECHANICAL POWER (MOTORS & GENERATORS). CONSEQUENTLY, THEY PROVIDE CRITICAL FUNCTIONS TO THE MAJOR SYSTEMS IN ELECTRIC AND HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLES. NEW ADVANCED SOFT MAGNETIC MATERIALS, SUCH AS GLASSY METALS AND AMORPHOUS/NANOCRYSTALLINE COMPOSITE ALLOYS, ARE ABLE TO OPERATE AT HIGHER FREQUENCIES WITH LOWER LOSSES AND HAVE TAILORABLE MAGNETIC PROPERTIES. THIS ALLOWS FOR A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE SIZE AND WEIGHT OF EFFICIENT ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS AND ENABLES NEW DEVICES THAT LEVERAGE THE UNIQUE MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF THESE ADVANCED MATERIALS. AS SHOWN IN FIGURE 1, BY INCREASING THE ALTERNATING CURRENT OR AC FREQUENCY, THE POWER RATIO, WHICH IS THE POWER NORMALIZED BY ITS LOSS, INCREASES AS MATERIAL SELECTION MOVES FROM SI STEELS TO AMORPHOUS ALLOYS TO NANOCRYSTALLINE ALLOYS. CONSEQUENTLY, NASA GRC HAS INVESTED OVER $1M IN THE LAST TWO YEARS TOWARDS NEW RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE TO PROCESS AND CHARACTERIZE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE TYPES OF NANO-SCALE MAGNETIC MATERIALS TO MEET THIS NASA MISSION GOAL. SUCH AN INVESTMENT SPEAKS TO THE OVERALL IMPORTANCE OF THESE NEW MATERIALS WITHIN NASA S MISSION. THEY HAVE ALSO SHIFTED KEY TECHNICAL SCIENTISTS INTO THIS AREA, WITH AN EMPHASIS IN PROCESSING AND PROPERTY CHARACTERIZATION. THOUGH THESE STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, THERE STILL EXISTS CRITICAL GAPS AT NASA NECESSARY TO BRING THIS NEW CLASS OF MATERIALS TO FRUITION. THIS HAS BEEN OUTLINED IN THE LETTER OF SUPPORT AND COLLABORATION WHICH CAN BE FOUND IN THE SUPPLEMENTARY SECTION OF THIS PROPOSAL.
 TO BRIDGE THE PROCESSING AND PROPERTY CONNECTIONS, THE COLLECTIVE EXPERTISE OF SCIENCE INVESTIGATOR (SC-I) C. MEWES AND CO-INVESTIGATORS (CO-IS) G. THOMPSON AND T. MEWES, AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA (UA), WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THIS NASA NEED THROUGH THIS GRANT. THE CLASSICAL MATERIALS SCIENCE TRIAD RELATING PROCESSING-STRUCTURE-AND PROPERTIES WILL BE LINKED BY BRINGING THE EXPERTISE FROM UA AND NASA TOGETHER IN THIS PROGRAM.  THESE LINKS ARE MADE THROUGH THE STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF PHASE, MORPHOLOGY, AND CHEMISTRY OF THESE NEW NANOCRYTALLINE COMPOSITE MATERIALS BY PROVIDING A MATERIALS-BY-DESIGN APPROACH.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_80NSSC18M0023_8000/,2018-08-13 18:11:27+00

JOHN,IN,INDIANA,463739516,01,USA,UNITED STATES,"PROPOSED SCOPE DESCRIPTION
 RELIABLE HIGH-TEMPERATURE MOLTEN SALT PUMPS ARE CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESSFUL DEPLOYMENT OF FHRS. EXTENSIVE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF MOLTEN SALT PUMPS WERE ACHIEVED DURING THE AIRCRAFT NUCLEAR PROPULSION (ANP), MOLTEN SALT REACTOR EXPERIMENT (MSRE), AND CONCENTRATED SOLAR POWER (CSP) PROGRAMS. THE LONG-SHAFTED, CANTILEVER MOLTEN SALT PUMPS ARE THE CURRENTLY LEADING CANDIDATE FOR LARGER-SCALE FHR PRIMARY PUMPS [1]. CANNED-ROTOR, MAGNETIC BEARINGS PUMPS, WITHOUT SALT-BEARING COMPATIBILITY ISSUES, PROVIDE A PREFERRED OPTION. HOWEVER, SUCH PUMP TYPE IS STILL IN ITS EARLY DEVELOPMENT PHASE. THE SHORT-SHAFT PUMPS, HAVING A SHORT SHAFT WITH AN OVERHUNG IMPELLER AND BEARINGS LOCATED ABOVE THE SHAFT SEAL, ARE TEMPERATURE LIMITED AND REQUIRE ADEQUATE LOCAL SHIELDING FROM NUCLEAR RADIATION. THE LONG-SHAFTED PUMPS ARE FAVORABLE FOR RADIOACTIVE, HIGH-TEMPERATURE FLUORIDE SALT APPLICATIONS, BUT REQUIRE SALT-LUBRICATED BEARINGS TO STABILIZE THE SHAFT AND COLUMNS DURING OPERATION. FLUORIDE-SALT-LUBRICATED BEARINGS REMAIN A SUBSTANTIAL ENGINEERING CHALLENGE MAINLY DUE TO THE MATERIAL CORROSION AND THERMAL DISTORTION. IN ADDITION, THE LONG-SHAFTED, VERTICAL PUMPS WITH SALT-LUBRICATED BEARINGS REQUIRE TO BE OPERATED BEFORE BEING FILLED WITH LIQUID SALT. THEREFORE, THE BEARINGS NEED TO BE CAPABLE OF DRY RUNNING FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME DURING STARTUP. OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES, SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED IN HIGH-TEMPERATURE BEARING TECHNOLOGIES. MODERN CERAMIC MATERIALS MAY RESOLVE THE SALT-LUBRICATED BEARING PERFORMANCE ISSUES. TWO PROMISING CANDIDATES ARE SILICON CARBIDE (SIC) AND DIAMOND BEARINGS. BOTH ARE COMPATIBLE WITH HIGH-TEMPERATURE FLUORIDE SALTS BUT HAVE NOT BEEN DEMONSTRATED FOR FHR APPLICATIONS IN A PROTOTYPICAL OPERATING ENVIRONMENT.
 HIGH-TEMPERATURE SHAFT SEALS ARE ESPECIALLY ESSENTIAL FOR THE FHR PRIMARY PUMPS AS THE TEMPERATURES OF FLUORIDE SALTS ARE HIGH AND LARGE CLEARANCES BETWEEN THE SHAFT AND SEAL LEAVE LARGER PATHS FOR POTENTIAL GASEOUS RADIONUCLIDE RELEASES. A NUMBER OF SEAL VARIANTS, INCLUDING MECHANICAL, GAS AND FROZEN SEALS, WERE INVESTIGATED FOR HIGH-TEMPERATURE PUMPS. OIL-LUBRICATED SEALS ARE COMMON PUMP TECHNOLOGY BUT ARE UNSUITABLE FOR USE IN FHRS BECAUSE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF CONTAMINATING THE COOLANT SALT WITH LEAKING HYDROCARBON LUBRICANTS AND EXCESSIVE FOAM DEVELOPMENT IN THE PRIMARY MOLTEN SALT. GAS-FOIL SEALS APPEAR TO BE APPLICABLE FOR SMALLER DIAMETER SHAFT FOR LARGE-SCALE PRIMARY PUMPS. STUFFING BOX TYPE SEALS USING VARIOUS PACKING MATERIALS CAN LEAD TO SHAFT SCORING AND UNACCEPTABLE GAS LEAKAGE RATES [2]. POTENTIAL SEAL CANDIDATES TO SEPARATE THE PRIMARY SALT COVE GAS ENVIRONMENT FROM THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT ARE LABYRINTH, METAL BELLOW, AND DIAMOND MECHANICAL SEALS.

 WE WILL DEVELOP STOCHASTIC ANALYSIS CAPABILITIES TO SUPPORT SHIP SYSTEM DESIGN UNDER PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY AND PARAMETRIC VARIABILITY. THESE CAPABILITIES WILL BENEFIT SHIP DESIGN PROCESS BY FACILITATING THE IDENTIFICATION OF CRITICAL STEPS THROUGH THE USE OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS FOR THE RANKING OF DESIGN DECISIONS, BY PROVIDING ADDITIONAL METRICS FOR THE EVALUATION OF THE COST-BENEFIT OF SPECIFIC DESIGN DECISION AND BY PROVIDING A FRAMEWORK FOR THE PROBABILISTIC REPRESENTATION OF EXTERNAL EVENTS IN MISSION ANALYSIS. WE EXPECT THE DEVELOPED STOCHASTIC CAPABILITIES TO ALSO BE BENEFICIAL FOR ELECTRIC POWER LOAD ANALYSIS (EPLA) AND FOR AUTOMATED DESIGN REFERENCE MISSION. THE MAIN CHALLENGES OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH ARE RELATED TO SCALABILITY, TO THE ABILITY TO DEAL WITH NON-LINEAR AND DISCONTINUOUS SYSTEMS, AND TO THE NEED OF DEFINING AN EFFECTIVE USER INTERFACE. AN INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE TOOL (MATLAB,C++) BASED ON OVERLOADING AND NON-INTRUSIVE POLYNOMIAL CHAOS REPRESENTATION AND KERNEL DENSITY APPROACHES WILL BE DEVELOPED.

 USC CONTROLS TASKS UNDER THRUST 1.3
 THE FOLLOWING THREE RELATED TASKS (USC 2, 3, AND 4) ARE DIRECTED TOWARDS INCORPORATING CONTROL INTO THE ENTIRE DDC. THESE TASKS PROVIDE COMPLEMENTARY TECHNOLOGIES/METHODS THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO A GENERAL, GLOBAL CONTROL SYSTEM.
 USC TASK 2: GENERALIZED APPROACH FOR INCORPORATING CONTROLS, THRUST 1.3 (SANTI)
 A STANDARDIZED WAY TO REPRESENT CONTROL AND ITS EFFECTS ON SYSTEM BEHAVIOR IS NEEDED IN THE EARLY DESIGN STAGES. A GENERAL APPROACH TO INCORPORATE CONTROLS IN THE FULL DESIGN DEVELOPMENT CYCLE WILL BE INTRODUCED. THE WORK WILL START WITH A CLASSIFICATION OF ANALYSIS TYPES OF INTEREST IN DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE DESIGN DEVELOPMENT CYCLE. AT THE SAME TYPE, THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONTROL WILL BE CLASSIFIED TOGETHER WITH THE EFFECTS THAT THEY HAVE ON CONVERTER AND SYSTEM BEHAVIOR. THEN THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF MODELING GRANULARITY WILL BE DEFINED FOR DIFFERENT ANALYSIS TYPES. IN PARTICULAR METHODS TO TRACK POWER AND ENERGY IN EARLY DESIGN STAGES WILL BE DEVELOPED. THE CONCEPT OF QUASI-STEADY STATE WILL BE INTRODUCED.
 DURATION: SPRING 2017 - FALL 2020
 USC TASK 3: LINKING SIMULATION LEVEL OF DETAIL, THRUST 1.3 (BENIGNI)
 WE WILL LINK CONTROL LEVEL OF DETAIL TO SIMULATION LEVEL OF DETAIL. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION PERFORMED IN USC TASK 4 WE WILL ANALYZE HOW DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CONTROL IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRE THE PERFORMANCE OF SIMULATION AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF DETAIL. THIS TASK IS STRICTLY RELATED TO TASK 17 (THRUST 4.3) AND TO THE DISCRETE EVENT COORDINATOR THAT WE WILL DEVELOP IN THAT TASK.

 USC TASK 4: METHOD FOR EXTRACTING THE CAPABILITIES AND CONSTRAINTS OF CONTROL SYSTEMS, THRUST 1.3 (GINN)
 WE WILL CLASSIFY CONTROL SYSTEMS AND EXPLORE METHODOLOGIES FOR EXTRACTING THE CAPABILITIES AND CONSTRAINTS OF THE VARIOUS CLASSES OF CONTROL SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO FORM CONTROL METAMODELS AT THE APPROPRIATE GRANULARITY FOR EARLY STAGE SHIP DESIGN. THIS WILL ENABLE DESIGNERS TO BUILD REPRESENTATIVE CONTROL SYSTEM BASELINES WHILE AVOIDING THE NEED TO ACTUALLY DESIGN A CONTROL SYSTEM FOR EVERY VARIANT EXPLORED IN EARLY STAGE DESIGN. THE OUTCOMES OF THE STUDY WILL BE EVALUATED USING THE S3D PLATFORM.

 USC TASK 5: ADVANCED TWO-PHASE COOLING FOR POWER ELECTRONIC CONVERTERS, THRUST 2.1 (KHAN, LI)
 WITH INCREASING POWER DENSITIES OF MODERN ELECTRONIC CONVERTERS, DISSIPATION OF HEAT (~1KW/CM2) IS VERY CHALLENGING CONSIDERING THE CONSTRAINTS ON SIZE AND WEIGHT BUDGET AS WELL AS THE REQUIREMENT OF TEMPERATURE UNIFORMITY. IT IS BEYOND THE CAPABILITY OF TRADITIONAL STATE-OF-THE-ART COOLING SOLUTIONS. TWO-PHASE MICROCHANNELS ARE PROMISING IN MEETING SUCH A CHALLENGING COOLING TASK AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE PIS  PREVIOUS FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH IN SI MICROCHANNELS. HOWEVER, TO IMPLEMENT ADVANCED TWO-PHASE COOLING TO POWER ELECTRONIC CONVERTERS, IT IS NECESSARY TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF ORIENTATION AND STRUCTURE USING AL/CU MINICHANNELS. WE SEEK TO SCALE AND INTEGRATE TWO-PHASE COOLING ON THE SUBSTRATE OF POWER ELECTRONIC CONVERTERS AND DEVELOP MODELS FOR CO-DESIGN OF ELECTRONIC-THERMAL SYSTEM. REALIZE INTEGRATED TWO-PHASE COOLING WILL ENABLE COMPACT, RELIABLE, AND HIGH PERFORMANCE POWER ELECTRONIC CONVERTERS.
 SCALE AND INTEGRATE TWO-PHASE COOLING ON THE SUBSTRATE OF POWER ELECTRONIC CONVERTERS AND DEVELOP MODELS FOR CO-DESIGN OF ELECTRONIC-THERMAL SYSTEM.
 DURATION: FALL 2016   SUMMER 2021
 USC TASK 6: WBG CONVERTERS MODELING, THRUST 2.1 (SANTI)
 WBG CONVERTERS WITH THEIR SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE ARE KEY ENABLERS OF THE ALL-ELECTRIC SHIP CONCEPT. IN ORDER TO DESIGN THE NEW ALL-ELECTRIC SHIP, SCALABLE WBG CONVERTER MODELS ARE NEEDED. ESRDC RESEARCHERS IN THE PAST HAVE DEVELOPED THE CONCEPT OF MODEL LEVELS AND APPLIED IT TO WBG DEVICES, DEVELOPING MODELS FOR THESE DEVICES AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF DETAIL. DIFFERENT MODEL LEVELS PROVIDE A DIFFERENT TRADE-OFF BETWEEN ACCURACY AND FIDELITY ON THE ONE SIDE AND COMPLEXITY AND SIMULATION COST ON THE OTHER SIDE. DIFFERENT MODEL LEVELS ARE APPROPRIATE TO PERFORM SPECIFIC STUDIES AND AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE DESIGN DEVELOPMENT CYCLE. THE CONCEPT OF MODEL LEVELS WILL BE EXTENDED TO WBG SWITCHING CONVERTERS, ENABLING THE COMPLETE DESIGN DEVELOPMENT CYCLE IN S3D.

 USC TASK 7: GLOBAL THERMAL EFFICIENCY VIA A THERMAL BUS, THRUST 2.2 (KHAN, LI)
 THE EFFICIENCY OF THERMAL MANAGEMENT OF A SHIP SYSTEM IS GREATLY AFFECTED BY THE ENVIRONMENT (CLIMATE, SEA WATER TEMPERATURE) IN WHICH IT OPERATES. OPTIMIZED DESIGN OF A HOT AND COLD THERMAL BUS WILL
 USC - ESRDC STATEMENT OF WORK   REVISED 2017-08-01
 PROVIDE HEAT SINK AND SOURCE THAT ARE INDEPENDENT OF LOCAL ENVIRONMENT (CLIMATE AND SEA WATER TEMPERATURE). THIS NEW THERMAL ARCHITECTURE WOULD GREATLY INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF CHILLERS AND HEAT PUMPS AND ALSO ALLOW US TO MORE EFFECTIVELY UTILIZE ABUNDANT WASTE HEAT. INITIAL CALCULATIONS BY THE PIS THAT SHOW THE PROMISE OF THE NEW CONCEPT IN ACHIEVING GLOBAL THERMAL EFFICIENCY OF ELECTRIC SHIPS THROUGH REALIZING TIMELY AND LOCALIZED HEATING/COOLING NEEDS BY DEVELOPING A THERMAL BUS. THE MAIN CHALLENGE WOULD BE TO DEMONSTRATE THE CONCEPT FOR MULTIZONAL ELECTRIC SHIP SYSTEM AND TO ESTABLISH A PROPER SET OF HIGH-FIDELITY MODELS FOR SHIP DESIGNS.
 TWO FLUID LINES WILL BE DESIGNED USING HIGH FIDELITY MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION: A THERMAL INTERFACE INTERACTION BETWEEN HIGH TEMPERATURE LINE FOR HEATING, AND A LOW TEMPERATURE LINE FOR COOLING. THE TEMPERATURE OF THE HOT FLUID LOOP MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AVAILABLE HIGH ENERGY DENSITY THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE (TES); WHILE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE COLD FLUID LOOP WILL BE SUSTAINED BY CHILLERS. ALL RELATED HEAT TRANSFER COMPONENTS (SUCH AS HEAT EXCHANGERS, PUMPS, TES, CONTROL SCHEMES, CHILLERS, ETC.) WILL BE MODELED AND VALIDATED. THROUGH COLLABORATING WITH MIT AND FSU, THE-STATE-OF-THE-ART HEAT TRANSFER TECHNOLOGIES AND MODELING TOOLS WILL BE EXPLORED AND UTILIZED TO OPTIMIZE THE COEFFICIENT OF PERFORMANCE OF THE THERMAL BUS. A LAB SCALE THERMAL BUS WILL BE DESIGNED, CHARACTERIZED, AND EVENTUALLY DEMONSTRATED. THE ESTABLISHED MODELS WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO S3D FOR SYSTEM LEVEL SHIP DESIGN.

 USC TASK 8: CONTROL METHODS FOR POWER AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT, SYSTEM STATE MONITORING AND SYSTEM STABILITY MANAGEMENT, THRUST 3.1 (SANTI)
 THE CPES CONCEPT IS CRITICALLY DEPENDENT ON THE CONTROL SYSTEMS THAT MANAGE THE SHIP S POWER AND ENERGY UNDER A WIDE VARIETY OF CONDITIONS AND FOR DIFFERENT MISSIONS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS TASK IS TO DEVELOP CONTROL ALGORITHMS AND METHODS THAT PROVIDE POWER AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT, SYSTEM STATE MONITORING AND SYSTEM STABILITY MANAGEMENT.
 THE ALL-ELECTRIC SHIP POWER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM IS ENABLED BY SWITCHING POWER CONVERTERS. THE PROPER OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM REQUIRES COORDINATED CONTROLS AND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE SYSTEM STATE. SWITCHING CONVERTERS CAN BE USED TO PROBE SYSTEM IMPEDANCES BY USING VIRTUAL NETWORK ANALYZER TECHNIQUES   PERTURBATION IS INTRODUCED IN THE SWITCHING CONVERTER CONTROL AND THE SYSTEM RESPONSE PROVIDES THE DESIRED SYSTEM IMPEDANCES. THIS OPENS THE POSSIBILITY OF REAL-TIME STATE MONITORING AND CONTROL ADAPTATION. TECHNIQUES AND ALGORITHMS WILL BE DEVELOPED TO INCORPORATE THESE NOVEL CAPABILITIES IN THE CPES DISTRIBUTED CONTROL. ADDITIONALLY, MULTI-CONVERTER SYSTEMS HAVE MULTIPLE CONTROL LOOPS AND THERE IS A STRONG POSSIBILITY OF ADVERSE CONTROL INTERACTIONS WHEN A LARGE SYSTEM IS PUT TOGETHER. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH ACTIVITY IS TO DEVELOP A MULTI-CONVERTER CONTROL DESIGN METHOD THAT GUARANTEES STABILITY AND PERFORMANCE UNDER VARYING OPERATING AND MISSION CONDITIONS.

 TO PERMIT DESIGN OF A DISTRIBUTED CONTROL SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES THE HIGHEST OBTAINABLE DEGREE OF SPECIFICITY WITH REGARD TO ENERGY FLOW IN THE SHIPBOARD POWER SYSTEM, WE WILL DEVELOP A GENERALIZED DISTRIBUTABLE OPTIMIZATION COST FUNCTION FOR APPLICATION IN POWER SYSTEM CONTROL. THIS WILL REQUIRE EXPANSION OF THE TIME SCALE OF OPERATION AS COMPARED TO THAT DEVELOPED IN EARLIER WORK IN THE INTELLIGENT CONTROL AREA AND, THUS, ENSURE ITS MORE GENERAL APPLICABILITY FOR SHIPBOARD POWER SYSTEM CONTROL. TOWARD THIS END A DISTRIBUTABLE COST FUNCTION FORMULATION WILL BE EXPLORED WITH THE GOAL OF MAXIMIZING POWER RAMP RATES BY SPECIFYING COORDINATION OF POWER ELECTRONIC CONVERTERS IN CONJUNCTION WITH ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS.
 DURATION: SPRING 2017 - FALL 2020
 USC TASK 10: HIGH FIDELITY SCALABLE THERMAL FLUID MODELS, THRUST 3.2 (KHAN, LI)
 HIGH FIDELITY SCALABLE THERMAL/FLUID MODELS ARE NEEDED TO REALIZE PRECISE TEMPERATURE CONTROL AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY, HOWEVER, THESE ARE CHALLENGING TO BE REALIZED IN TERM OF SCALABILITY AND VALIDATION. THROUGH EXISTING COLLABORATIONS WITH MIT AND FSU, WE SEEK TO DEVELOP HIGH FIDELITY SCALABLE THERMAL FLUID MODELS FOR COMPONENT LEVEL AS WELL AS FOR SUB-SYSTEM LEVEL MODELS THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED BY FSU. WE WILL ALSO SUPPORT MIT S EFFORT IN DEVELOPING NUMERICAL SIMULATION TOOLS THROUGH PROVIDING EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATIONS FROM COMPONENT LEVEL TO SUB-SYSTEM LEVEL. THESE MODELS/SIMULATIONS WILL BE USED TO OPTIMIZE COMPONENT LEVEL OR SUB-SYSTEM THERMAL FLUID SYSTEMS.
 DURATION: FALL 2016   SUMMER 2021
 USC TASK 11: DESIGN GUIDANCE, THRUST 4.1 (DOUGAL)
 WE WILL EXPERIMENTALLY DETERMINE WHETHER AND HOW DESIGN GUIDANCE OR DESIGN EVALUATION USING AI TOOLS DEVELOPED BY FSU WILL AID THE DESIGN PROCESS. WE WILL DEFINE AND TEST AT LEAST TWO APIS THAT SUPPORT USER EXPERIMENTATION WITH DESIGN AND DECISION SUPPORT GUIDELINES, ONE REACTIVE AND ONE PROACTIVE. THE REACTIVE TOOL WILL QUERY A DESIGN THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN ASSEMBLED IN S3D TO EVALUATE WHETHER IT SATISFIES STANDARDS. THE PROACTIVE TOOL WILL BE ENGAGED AS THE DESIGNER BUILDS A SYSTEM, LOOKING FROM THE DESIGNER S PERSPECTIVE OUTWARDS TO THE DESIGN GUIDANCE AND OFFERING DESIGN SUGGESTIONS. SOME EXPERIMENTATION WILL BE REQUIRED TO DETERMINE HOW BEST TO ALLOW THE DESIGN GUIDANCE SYSTEM TO SYNERGISTICALLY INTERACT WITH AND HELP REFINE THE USER S INPUTS TO THE DESIGN. THE OUTCOME OF THIS TASK IS EXPECTED TO BE AN IMPROVED TOOL THAT WILL REDUCE THE TIME AND EFFORT REQUIRED TO DEVELOP A NOVEL SHIP DESIGN THAT ADHERES TO THE NAVY S BEST PRACTICES AND DESIGN STANDARDS.

 IT IS CHALLENGING TO QUANTIFY THE PERFORMANCE OF A SHIP SCALE THERMAL SYSTEM CONSIDERING THE COMPLEX THERMAL/FLUID INTERACTIONS AND THE LARGE SCALE IN TERMS OF SIZE AND TIME. ANOTHER CHALLENGE IS HOW TO INTEGRATE THE DEVELOPED THERMAL FLUID MODELS INTO S3D FOR SMOOTH INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER SUB-SYSTEMS. TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, THROUGH COLLABORATING WITH MIT AND FSU, THE FOLLOWING METHODOLOGIES WILL BE DEVELOPED: (1) A HIGH-FIDELITY MULTIDISCIPLINARY DESIGN OPTIMIZATION APPROACH WITH COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS AND OTHER TOOLS FOR THE COMPONENT LEVEL MODELING AND SCALING LAW OF FLOW, HEAT TRANSFER, AND COMPONENT DESIGNS; (2) A MEDIUM-FIDELITY APPROACH FOR THE OPTIMIZATION OF THE SYSTEM LEVEL THERMAL FLUID SYSTEM DESIGN; AND (3) A FRIENDLY INTERFACE WITH ELECTRIC SYSTEM AND MECHANIC SYSTEM WILL BE DEVELOPED TO ENABLE A COHERENT DATA FLOW AT SHIP LEVEL MODELING.

 USC TASK 13: CONTROL MODEL & SOLVER, THRUST 4.2 (DOUGAL, SANTI)
 WE WILL INVESTIGATE HOW TO EXTEND A SYSTEM DEFINITION SO THAT IT OPERATES ACCORDING TO INPUTS FROM AN OPERATING POINT OPTIMIZER AS REPRESENTED BY THE SURROGATE CONTROL, PROVIDING A CAPABILITY FOR A DESIGN CONCEPT TO BE EVALUATED ACCORDING TO REALISTIC OPERATING POINTS ESTABLISHED BY THE CONTROLS. THE CHALLENGE WILL BE IN IMPLEMENTING METHODS TO EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY CAPTURE THE USER S INTENT WHILE RETAINING THE AGILE DESIGN GOALS FOR THE S3D ENVIRONMENT. ONE APPROACH TO BE INVESTIGATED WILL ENTRAIN THE CONTROL OBJECTIVES IN EACH BUS (ELECTRIC, THERMAL, ETC.) SO THAT EVERY OBJECT ATTACHED TO ANY BUS WILL INHERIT ITS CONTROL OBJECTIVES. THIS TASK DOES NOT TARGET DYNAMIC CONTROL, RATHER, IT AIMS TO YIELD A PROPER EVALUATION OF POWER AND ENERGY FLOWS DURING A MISSION SEGMENT. ONCE FULLY IMPLEMENTED THIS TOOL WILL INCREASE THE FIDELITY OF THE SHIP MODEL AND PERMIT IT TO BE MORE REALISTICALLY EXERCISED AND EVALUATED.

 USC TASK 14: CONTROLS CO-SIMULATION, THRUST 4.2 (DOUGAL, GINN)
 WE WILL INVESTIGATE METHODS THAT ENABLE A CONTROL OBJECT TO DISCOVER THE COMPONENTS WITHIN A DESIGN THAT ARE CONTROLLABLE AND THEN PERMIT THIS OBJECT TO APPLY ITS CONTROL INPUTS AND OUTPUTS TO THOSE COMPONENTS. THE TECHNICAL CHALLENGE WILL BE TO DEVELOP THE CAPABILITY FOR S3D TO PROVIDE SELF-DESCRIBING ABSTRACT ENDPOINTS THAT WILL BE CAPABLE OF BEING BOUND CONCRETELY WHEN CO-SIMULATING WITH GENERALIZABLE CONTROL ALGORITHMS. THE CONTROL ALGORITHMS MAY BE DEVELOPED EITHER INTERNALLY OR EXTERNALLY TO S3D AND WILL BE ABLE TO AUTOMATICALLY AND PROGRAMMATICALLY CONNECT TO A DESIGN AND EXERT CONTROL OVER THE SYSTEM WHILE EXECUTING MISSIONS. WE WILL DEVELOP A METHODOLOGY FOR SYNCHRONIZING THE MODEL OF THE CONTROL SYSTEM WITH THE MODEL OF THE PHYSICAL SYSTEM. UPON COMPLETION OF THIS WORK S3D WILL HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO PERMIT CONTROL ALGORITHMS TO BE QUICKLY AND EASILY APPLIED, EXERCISED, AND EVALUATED AGAINST DESIGNS.

 PROVIDE HEAT SINK AND SOURCE THAT ARE INDEPENDENT OF LOCAL ENVIRONMENT (CLIMATE AND SEA WATER TEMPERATURE). THIS NEW THERMAL ARCHITECTURE WOULD GREATLY INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF CHILLERS AND HEAT PUMPS AND ALSO ALLOW US TO MORE EFFECTIVELY UTILIZE ABUNDANT WASTE HEAT. INITIAL CALCULATIONS BY THE PIS THAT SHOW THE PROMISE OF THE NEW CONCEPT IN ACHIEVING GLOBAL THERMAL EFFICIENCY OF ELECTRIC SHIPS THROUGH REALIZING TIMELY AND LOCALIZED HEATING/COOLING NEEDS BY DEVELOPING A THERMAL BUS. THE MAIN CHALLENGE WOULD BE TO DEMONSTRATE THE CONCEPT FOR MULTIZONAL ELECTRIC SHIP SYSTEM AND TO ESTABLISH A PROPER SET OF HIGH-FIDELITY MODELS FOR SHIP DESIGNS.
 TWO FLUID LINES WILL BE DESIGNED USING HIGH FIDELITY MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION: A THERMAL INTERFACE INTERACTION BETWEEN HIGH TEMPERATURE LINE FOR HEATING, AND A LOW TEMPERATURE LINE FOR COOLING. THE TEMPERATURE OF THE HOT FLUID LOOP MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AVAILABLE HIGH ENERGY DENSITY THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE (TES); WHILE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE COLD FLUID LOOP WILL BE SUSTAINED BY CHILLERS. ALL RELATED HEAT TRANSFER COMPONENTS (SUCH AS HEAT EXCHANGERS, PUMPS, TES, CONTROL SCHEMES, CHILLERS, ETC.) WILL BE MODELED AND VALIDATED. THROUGH COLLABORATING WITH MIT AND FSU, THE-STATE-OF-THE-ART HEAT TRANSFER TECHNOLOGIES AND MODELING TOOLS WILL BE EXPLORED AND UTILIZED TO OPTIMIZE THE COEFFICIENT OF PERFORMANCE OF THE THERMAL BUS.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS TASK IS TO DEVELOP CONTROL ALGORITHMS AND METHODS THAT PROVIDE POWER AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT, SYSTEM STATE MONITORING AND SYSTEM STABILITY MANAGEMENT.
 THE ALL-ELECTRIC SHIP POWER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM IS ENABLED BY SWITCHING POWER CONVERTERS. THE PROPER OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM REQUIRES COORDINATED CONTROLS AND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE SYSTEM STATE. SWITCHING CONVERTERS CAN BE USED TO PROBE SYSTEM IMPEDANCES BY USING VIRTUAL NETWORK ANALYZER TECHNIQUES   PERTURBATION IS INTRODUCED IN THE SWITCHING CONVERTER CONTROL AND THE SYSTEM RESPONSE PROVIDES THE DESIRED SYSTEM IMPEDANCES. THIS OPENS THE POSSIBILITY OF REAL-TIME STATE MONITORING AND CONTROL ADAPTATION. TECHNIQUES AND ALGORITHMS WILL BE DEVELOPED TO INCORPORATE THESE NOVEL CAPABILITIES IN THE CPES DISTRIBUTED CONTROL. ADDITIONALLY, MULTI-CONVERTER SYSTEMS HAVE MULTIPLE CONTROL LOOPS AND THERE IS A STRONG POSSIBILITY OF ADVERSE CONTROL INTERACTIONS WHEN A LARGE SYSTEM IS PUT TOGETHER. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH ACTIVITY IS TO DEVELOP A MULTI-CONVERTER CONTROL DESIGN METHOD THAT GUARANTEES STABILITY AND PERFORMANCE UNDER VARYING OPERATING AND MISSION CONDITIONS.

PROSTATE CANCER SCREENING, WHICH DISSEMINATED RAPIDLY AND WIDELY INTO US PRACTICE IN THE 1990S, IS BEING CONSIDERED MORE CAUTIOUSLY FOLLOWING THE RECOMMENDATION AGAINST ROUTINE PSA SCREENING FROM THE US PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE. CONCERNS ABOUT OVERDIAGNOSIS AND OVERTREATMENT HAVE LED TO A GROWING CONSENSUS AMONG CLINICAL RESEARCHERS THAT ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE IS A VIABLE AND EVEN PREFERRED APPROACH FOR MANAGEMENT OF NEWLY DIAGNOSED, LOW RISK CASES. THESE TRENDS ARE PART OF AN INCREASING RECOGNITION AMONG CLINICIANS, PATIENTS AND POLICYMAKERS THAT CURRENT PATTERNS OF SCREENING AND TREATMENT FOR THE DISEASE ARE NOT SUSTAINABLE. RATHER, SMART APPROACHES THAT OPTIMIZE BENEFIT ACROSS THE CONTINUUM OF CARE WHILE LIMITING COST AND HARM ARE CRITICALLY NEEDED. 
 
 THE CISNET PROSTATE GROUP NOW FINDS ITSELF IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO ADDRESS ONGOING AND NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT PROSTATE CANCER CONTROL ACROSS THE CONTINUUM OF CARE. THESE INCLUDE (1) HOW BEST TO UTILIZE SCREENING AND TREATMENT IN HETEROGENEOUS POPULATIONS, (2) WHAT STANDARDS SHOULD BE RECOMMENDED FOR IMPLEMENTING ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE AND (3) HOW TO INTEGRATE NEW MARKERS OF RISK, NEW DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND NEW TREATMENTS FOR OPTIMAL DISEASE CONTROL IN PRACTICE. IN RECENT YEARS A NUMBER OF POLYGENIC ASSAYS FOR DISEASE RISK HAVE BEEN MADE PUBLIC, AND STUDIES OF GENE EXPRESSION AND ADVANCED IMAGING FOR DISEASE PROGNOSIS ARE PRODUCING PROMISING FINDINGS. FURTHER, NOVEL TREATMENTS FOR METASTATIC AND CASTRATE-RESISTANT TUMORS HAVE BEEN APPROVED AND ARE DISSEMINATING INTO PRACTICE. WHETHER AND HOW THESE DEVELOPMENTS SHOULD BE INTEGRATED INTO SCREENING AND TREATMENT POLICIES IS CONTROVERSIAL.
 
 THE OVERARCHING OBJECTIVE OF THIS APPLICATION IS TO UTILIZE THE CISNET PROSTATE MODELS TO ADDRESS ONGOING AND NEW HIGH-IMPACT CLINICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH QUESTIONS IN PROSTATE CANCER CONTROL THAT CANNOT EASILY BE TACKLED BY EMPIRICAL STUDIES. THE VALUE OF CALIBRATED MODELS OF DISEASE IS THAT THEY CAN IN PRINCIPLE BE USED TO CONSTRUCT VIRTUAL STUDIES COMPARING DIFFERENT INTERVENTIONS AND THEIR IMPACT ON DOWNSTREAM OUTCOMES. EVEN IF EMPIRICAL STUDIES EXIST, MODELS MAY STILL BE NEEDED TO BRIDGE FROM THE STUDY CONTEXT OR TIME HORIZON TO THE RELEVANT POLICY SETTING. IN THE PREVIOUS FUNDING PERIOD WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY USED MODELING FOR THESE PURPOSES. OUR CUMULATIVE EXPERTISE IN PROSTATE MODELING, OUR EXISTING MODELS THAT HAVE BEEN CALIBRATED AGAINST TRIALS AND POPULATIONS, AND OUR CLOSE TIES WITH PROMINENT CLINICAL EXPERTS WHO PROVIDE ACCESS LARGE, HIGH-QUALITY DATASETS FOR MODEL VALIDATION AND CALIBRATION, POSITION US WELL TO UNIQUELY CONTRIBUTE TO NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL DIALOGUE ABOUT HOW BEST TO ADDRESS AND CONTROL THIS MOST COMMON CANCER IN MEN.
 THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS WILL BE PURSUED:
 
 AIM 1. IDENTIFY ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE STRATEGIES THAT MINIMIZE PATIENT BURDEN WITHOUT INCREASING RISKS OF PROGRESSION TO NON-CURABLE DISEASE OR DEATH.
 THE UMICH GROUP WILL WORK ON:
 1. EXTEND THE MODELS TO INCORPORATE A MECHANISM OF CANCER PROGRESSION THROUGH STAGES AND GRADES OVER TIME

 3. DEVELOP RANGES OF BENEFIT FOR THE IMPACT OF DIFFERENT SALVAGE THERAPY OPTIONS ON METASTASIS, PROSTATE CANCER DEATHS AND OTHER-CAUSE DEATHS BASED ON EXISTING OBSERVATIONAL COHORTS AND MODELS.
 4. MODEL THE OUTCOMES OF THE DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF PRIMARY AND SALVAGE THERAPIES; OUTCOMES WILL INCLUDE METASTASES PREVENTED, PROSTATE CANCER DEATHS PREVENTED, FREQUENCY OF DIFFERENT TREATMENT MORBIDITIES, OVERTREATMENT (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY) AND OTHER-CAUSE DEATHS. 5. STUDY IMPLICATIONS OF SALVAGE THERAPIES FOR PROSTATE CANCER CONTROL. IMPLEMENT SALVAGE THERAPY TREATMENT AT PSA RECURRENCE IN THE CISNET MODELS BY PRIMARY TREATMENT TYPE USING RECENTLY PUBLISHED DATA FROM CAPSURE ON TRENDS IN USE OF SALVAGE THERAPIES AT PSA RECURRENCE. PROJECT PROSTATE CANCER MORTALITY IN THE PRESENCE AND ABSENCE OF TREATMENT AT PSA RECURRENCE BASED ON THE MODELS DEVELOPED IN THIS AIM TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF EARLY TREATMENT OF PSA RECURRENCE ON POPULATION PROSTATE CANCER MORTALITY TRENDS.
 
 AIM 4: DETERMINE WHETHER RACIAL DISPARITIES IN PROSTATE CANCER MORTALITY CAN BE REDUCED BY USING STRATIFIED SCREENING AND TREATMENT STRATEGIES.
 THE UMICH GROUP WILL WORK ON:
 1. DEVELOP A SET OF GENERATORS FOR TREATMENT PATTERNS ACCORDING TO US POPULATION FREQUENCIES AND THE MODEL-BASED RACE-SPECIFIC STATISTICAL ANALYSES OF PROSTATE CANCER.
 2. EVALUATE THE CONTRIBUTION OF RACIAL DISPARITIES AND RACE-SPECIFIC COVARIATES TO DISPARITIES IN MORTALITY
 3. MODEL DIFFERENT SCREENING AND PRIMARY TREATMENT PROTOCOLS BY RACE AND DETERMINE WHETHER MORE INTENSIVE SCREENING (E.G., BEGINNING EARLIER, SCREENING MORE FREQUENTLY) OR TREATMENT (E.G., MORE RP AND/OR LESS AS IN BLACK MEN) CAN CLOSE THE GAP BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE MEN.
 
 AIM 5: MODULARIZE MODELS TO EVALUATE CANCER CONTROL PROGRAMS IN NON-US POPULATIONS, INCLUDING LOW-RESOURCE COUNTRIES.
 THE UMICH GROUP WILL WORK ON:
 1. RECALIBRATE THE UMICH NATURAL HISTORY AND MORTALITY MODELS AND CLINICAL PRACTICE GENERATORS TO POPULATIONS OF UK AND THE CARRIBEAN.
 2. MODEL DIFFERENT SCREENING AND TREATMENT STRATEGIES IN EACH SETTING AND IDENTIFY APPROACHES THAT ARE PREFERRED IN TERMS OF POPULATION OUTCOMES AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS. THE SPECIFIC PROTOCOLS TO BE EXAMINED WILL BE DETERMINED IN COLLABORATION WITH PARTNERS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN RESEARCH AND PATIENT CARE IN EACH SETTING.
 
 AIM 6: DEVELOP ONLINE CALCULATORS TO SUPPORT SHARED PHYSICIAN-PATIENT DECISIONS ABOUT SCREENING, PRIMARY TREATMENT, OR SECONDARY TREATMENT GIVEN A PATIENT S CLINICAL INFORMATION AND PREFERENCES.
 THE UMICH GROUP WILL WORK ON:
 1. DEVELOP A UMICH MODEL-BASED BACK ENGINE FOR THE ONLINE CALCULATORS THAT ACCEPT INFORMATION ABOUT PATIENT STRATA AND PREFERENCES AND SUMMARIZES CORRESPONDING MODEL-PROJECTED OUTCOMES USING TABLES AND FIGURES FOR A RANGE OF POSSIBLE CLINICAL COURSES.
 2. POPULATE A REPOSITORY OF RELEVANT SCREENING, PRIMARY TREATMENT, AND SECONDARY TREATMENT SCENARIOS FOR THE US POPULATION AND UNDER A RANGE OF RISKS OF CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT EFFICACY FOR NON-US POPULATIONS.

PROPOSED EFFORT
 THE PROPOSED EFFORT COMBINES ADVANCED IMAGING CAPABILITIES WITH A UNIQUE COMBUSTION SPRAY CHAMBER TO
 STUDY THE NEAR-ORIFICE REGION OF HIGH-INJECTION PRESSURE DIESEL SPRAYS. THE OPTICALLY THICK NEAR-ORIFICE REGION
 OF THE SPRAY WILL BE IMAGED USING TWO SYSTEMS: UCI FS HOLOGRAPHY AND CSM PS BALLISTIC IMAGING AND
 SCATTERING. WHEN COMBINED WITH THE HIGH-TEMPERATURE/HIGH-PRESSURE OPTICALLY ACCESSIBLE SPRAY CHAMBER,
 THESE IMAGING TECHNIQUES WILL PROBE REGIONS OF COMBUSTING SPRAYS THAT HAVE NEVER BEFORE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY
 IMAGED UNDER COMBUSTION CONDITIONS. THE PROPOSED EFFORT WILL MOVE OUR CURRENT SINGLE-SHOT, LINE-OF-SIGHT
 IMAGING CAPABILITY INTO VOLUMETRIC AND TRANSIENT IMAGING.
 DIAGNOSTIC DEVELOPMENT
 OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, CSM HAS DEVELOPED AND CHARACTERIZED A PICOSECOND LINE-OF-SIGHT BALLISTIC
 IMAGING TECHNIQUE THAT HAS BEEN USED TO SUCCESSFULLY IMAGE DIESEL SPRAYS AT DIESEL ENGINE PRE-INJECTION
 CONDITIONS [1], [2]. WE HAVE RECENTLY EXPANDED THIS TECHNIQUE TO BALLISTIC SCATTERING, WHICH PROBES A SPRAY S
 INTERIOR AT THE PLANE OF A THIN LIGHT SHEET. THIS EFFORT WILL COMBINE THESE ADVANCES WITH THE RECENTLY
 DEVELOPED HOLOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUE AT UCI TO QUANTIFY THE IMAGING CAPABILITY OF THE HOLOGRAPHY IN NEAR-NOZZLE
 SPRAYS UNDER DIESEL ENGINE CONDITIONS. COMBINING THE TWO SYSTEMS WILL ACCOMPLISH THE FOLLOWING:
 1. VOLUMETRIC IMAGING DEVELOPMENT. SIMULTANEOUS LINE-OF-SIGHT BALLISTIC IMAGING AND HOLOGRAPHIC
 BALLISTIC IMAGING WILL BE USED TO QUANTIFY THE ADVANTAGES OF HOLOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUE. IT WILL ALSO
 PROVIDE A NEEDED BENCHMARK IN OPTICAL RESOLUTION FOR THE HOLOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUE. BALLISTIC
 SCATTERING WILL THEN BE COMBINED WITH HOLOGRAPHIC BALLISTIC IMAGING TO COMPARE CAPTURED INTERNAL
 FEATURES IN THE SPRAY. AS THE SHEET WIDTH OF THE BALLISTIC SCATTERING TECHNIQUE IS ~100 &#956;M, AND A
 DIRECT COMPARISON OF CAPTURED IMAGES WILL AID IN INTERPRETING HOLOGRAPHIC RECONSTRUCTED IMAGES.
 2. TEMPORAL EFFECTS IN IMAGING. TWO-COLOR BALLISTIC HOLOGRAPHY PRODUCES A SERIES OF TWO IMAGES IN
 SUCCESSION FOR THE SAME SPRAY FROM THE SAME POINT OF VIEW, REVEALING SPRAY VELOCITY, AS WELL AS
 SPRAY LIGAMENT VELOCITY AND ACCELERATION   KEY QUANTITIES FOR SPRAY MODELING VALIDATION.
 COMBINING THE FS LASER SYSTEM FROM UCI WITH THE PS LASER SYSTEM AT CSM WILL ALLOW UP TO FOUR
 SEQUENTIAL LASER PULSES FOR TRULY TRANSIENT IMAGING OF THE SPRAY.
 SPRAY STUDIES
 THE CSM OPTICALLY ACCESSIBLE COMBUSTING SPRAY CHAMBER (REFERRED TO HEREAFTER AS DIESEL ENGINE SIMULATOR)
 ENABLES IMAGING OF SPRAYS UNDER CONDITIONS TYPICAL OF PRE-INJECTION IN DIESEL ENGINES. PREVIOUS IMAGING
 CAMPAIGNS HAVE REVEALED SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE FROM CHARGE TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE ON SPRAY SHEDDING AND
 FUEL TYPE [3]. THE PROPOSED EFFORT WILL MOVE FROM LINE-OF-SITE IMAGING, TO VOLUMETRIC IMAGING USING BALLISTIC
 SCATTERING AND HOLOGRAPHIC RECONSTRUCTION; REVEALING FOR THE FIRST TIME INTERNAL STRUCTURES OF DIESEL SPRAYS
 UNDER ENGINE CONDITIONS.
 CSM HAS ADDED HIGHER-RESOLUTION CAMERAS COMBINED WITH AN IMPROVED OPTICAL LAYOUT AND HIGHER QUALITY
 OPTICAL COMPONENTS TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE IMAGING RESOLUTION AT LARGE WORKING DISTANCES (~10 MICRONS).
 THESE LOWER NOISE, HIGHER RESOLUTION IMAGES ENABLE INVESTIGATION OF THE IMPORTANT SMALL LENGTH-SCALE
 PHENOMENON IN SPRAYS. CSM WILL UNDERTAKE TWO MODELING EFFORTS TO IMPROVE IMAGING QUALITY AND
 RESOLUTION IN THE UCI HOLOGRAPHIC SYSTEM:
 1. DESIGN AND OPTIMIZE OPTICAL TRAIN FOR LARGE WORKING DISTANCES: OPTICAL MODELING SOFTWARE
 (ZEMAX), WAS CRITICAL TO IMPROVING THE IMAGING QUALITY OF THE CSM SYSTEM. WITH AN EXTENSIVE
 LIBRARY OF OPTICAL COMPONENTS, ZEMAX ENABLES ENGINEERING DESIGN OF THE OPTICAL TRAIN AND SIMULATION
 OF MAXIMUM RESOLUTION. THIS, TOGETHER WITH LESSONS LEARNED FROM OPTICAL DESING OF PS BALLISTIC
 IMAGING AND SCATTERING WILL BE USED TO IMPROVE THE RESOLUTION OF THE HOLOGRAPHIC OPTICAL TRAIN.
 2. COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS MODELING OF THE HEATED PRESSURE VESSEL. THE CSM HEATED
 PRESSURE VESSEL ENABLES INJECTION STUDIES AT DIESEL ENGINE COND",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_W911NF2010102_2100/,2020-08-31 17:25:49+00

 NASA THERMAL CONTROL SYSTEMS EMPLOY LIQUIDS TO COOL HEAT-GENERATING (HOT) COMPONENTS, EFFICIENTLY TRANSPORT THAT ENERGY TO OTHER LOCATIONS, AND DELIVER IT TO COOLER COMPONENTS THAT EITHER REQUIRE THERMAL ENERGY, OR REJECT THAT ENERGY TO SPACE.  THE HEAT EXCHANGERS AT THE INTERFACES BETWEEN THE COOLANT AND COMPONENTS WHOSE TEMPERATURES ARE BEING CONTROLLED ARE RELATIVELY LARGE AND HEAVY.  AUGMENTED SINGLE-PHASE (IN WHICH THE WORKING FLUID NEITHER BOILS NOR CONDENSES) AND PHASE-CHANGE (IN WHICH THE FLUID BOILS AND/OR CONDENSES) HEAT TRANSFER TECHNOLOGIES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO GREATLY REDUCE THE SIZE AND WEIGHT OF THE HEAT EXCHANGERS AND IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE CRUCIAL COMPONENTS.
 
 A HIGHLY-INTEGRATED, STATE-WIDE RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL ADVANCEMENT PROGRAM IS PROPOSED AMONG THE THREE NEVADA SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION (NSHE) RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS: THE UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA, RENO (UNR), THE UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA, LAS VEGAS (UNLV) AND THE DESERT RESEARCH INSTITUTE (DRI).  THE OBJECTIVES ARE TO DEVELOP ADVANCED SINGLE-PHASE AND PHASE-CHANGE HEAT TRANSFER TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL ENHANCE THE PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY NASA THERMAL MANAGEMENT/CONTROL SYSTEM.  THIS WORK WILL SERVE AS A CASE STUDY FOR INNOVATIVE AND INTERACTIVE EDUCATIONAL MODULES, AND FOSTER THE DEVELOPMENT OF SPINOFF COMPANIES.  THE UNR MECHANICAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY HIRING NEW FACULTY MEMBERS WITH RESEARCH EXPERTISE IN THERMAL SCIENCE AND COMPUTATIONAL MECHANICS.  THESE JUNIOR FACULTY WILL BE GAIN VALUABLE EXPERIENCE IN AREAS OF INTEREST TO NASA BY BEING INVOLVED IN THE PROPOSED RESEARCH.  
 
 SPECIFICALLY, THIS PROGRAM WILL:
 
 1) DEVELOP ADVANCED SINGLE-PHASE AND PHASE-CHANGE HEAT TRANSFER TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL REDUCE THE SIZE, WEIGHT, POWER REQUIREMENTS AND COST OF NASA THERMAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS.  THIS WORK WILL RESULTS IN REFEREED CONFERENCE PRESENTATIONS AND ARCHIVAL JOURNAL PUBLICATIONS.  
 2) PERFORM PROOF-OF-CONCEPT TESTS TO DEMONSTRATE THE APPLICABILITY OF THESE HEAT TRANSFER TECHNOLOGIES TO NASA THERMAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS.  
 3) HELP NEVADA MEET ITS NEED FOR A WELL-TRAINED AND DIVERSIFIED WORK FORCE BY:  
 A. TRAINING MULTIPLE PH.D. AND MS STUDENTS IN EXPERIMENTAL AND COMPUTATIONAL HEAT TRANSFER RESEARCH.  
 B. INTEGRATING THE UNIQUE CHALLENGING POSED BY NASA THERMAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND THE SOLUTIONS DEVELOP BY THE CURRENT RESEARCH PROGRAM INTO INTERACTIVE EDUCATIONAL MODULES.

 RATIONALE AND APPROACH/PROGRAM DESIGN
 A: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
 KIPP NEW JERSEY (FORMERLY TEAM CHARTER SCHOOLS) PROPOSES TO HAVE 11 AMERICORPS MEMBERS WHO
 WILL PROVIDE SMALL-GROUP INSTRUCTION, CLASSROOM ASSISTANCE AND SCHOOL-WIDE SPECIAL PROJECT SUPPORT IN
 NEWARK AND CAMDEN, NEW JERSEY. AT THE END OF THE FIRST PROGRAM YEAR, THE AMERICORPS MEMBERS
 WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR STUDENTS MEETING THEIR INDIVIDUALIZED MAP® AND READING GROWTH GOALS. 
 
 THIS PROGRAM WILL FOCUS ON THE CNCS FOCUS AREA(S) OF EDUCATION. THE CNCS INVESTMENT OF $151,030
 WILL BE MATCHED WITH A $50,000 PRIVATE DONATION AND $248,384 MATCHED BY KIPP NEW JERSEY.
 B1: PROBLEM/NEED
 
 IN THE UNITED STATES, 8% OF LOW-INCOME STUDENTS NATIONALLY GRADUATE FROM 4-YEAR COLLEGES (WITHIN SIX
 YEARS). THIS CATASTROPHICALLY LOW RATE CONTRASTS WITH A NATIONAL AVERAGE GRADUATION RATE OF 29% AND
 AN AVERAGE RATE OF 71% FOR HIGH-INCOME STUDENTS. WITHOUT A COLLEGE DEGREE, EARNING POTENTIAL AND
 OPPORTUNITIES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIMINISHED. ACCORDING TO THE LUMINA FOUNDATION, INCREASING THE
 NUMBER OF COLLEGE GRADUATES BOLSTERS THE ECONOMY AND STRENGTHENS OUR DEMOCRACY AND COMMUNITIES.
 EDUCATION ATTAINMENT LEADS TO IMPROVED HEALTH, LOWER CRIME RATES, AND INCREASED GLOBALLY AWARE
 CITIZENS MORE LIKELY TO PARTICIPATE IN CIVIC AND DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES, SUCH AS VOTING AND VOLUNTEERING
 (1). 
 
 KIPP NEW JERSEY SERVES TWO HIGH POVERTY CITIES IN NEW JERSEY. ACCORDING TO ADVOCATES FOR CHILDREN
 OF NEW JERSEY, IN THE CITY OF NEWARK, ONLY 25% OF RESIDENTS HAD SOME COLLEGE OR ASSOCIATES IN ART
 DEGREE OR HIGHER IN 2013 (2). 87% OF KIPP NEW JERSEY STUDENTS IN NEWARK QUALIFY FOR FREE OR REDUCED
 LUNCH, AND 100% OF KIPP NEW JERSEY STUDENTS IN CAMDEN QUALIFY FOR FREE LUNCH. KIPP NEW JERSEY IS
 PROVIDING A WORLD-CLASS EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS IN NEWARK AND CAMDEN AND STUDENTS ARE MAKING
 SIGNIFICANT ACADEMIC GAINS, BUT THESE GAINS ALONE ARE NOT ENOUGH GIVEN THE IMMENSITY OF THE
 ACHIEVEMENT GAP. 
 
 WHILE IT IS KIPP NEW JERSEY'S MISSION TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF POVERTY IN OUR CITIES BY DOUBLING THE COLLEGE
 GRADUATION RATE IN NEWARK AND TRIPLING THE COLLEGE GRADUATION RATE IN CAMDEN, OUR STUDENTS ARE NOT

 NARRATIVES
 PROGRESSING ACADEMICALLY QUICKLY ENOUGH TO GET THEM COLLEGE READY. ACCORDING TO THE ACT® COLLEGE
 READINESS BENCHMARKS, THE MINIMUM ACT® COLLEGE READINESS ASSESSMENT SCORE REQUIRED FOR STUDENTS
 TO HAVE A HIGH PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS IN CREDIT-BEARING COLLEGE COURSES IS A COMPOSITE SCORE OF 21 (3). IN
 THE 2013-14 SCHOOL YEAR, KIPP NEW JERSEY STUDENTS PERFORMED ON AVERAGE THE HIGHEST WE HAVE EVER
 SEEN IN OUR NETWORK. HOWEVER, THE CLASS AVERAGE ACT® COMPOSITE SCORE WAS ONLY A 19. IN THE 2014-
 15 SCHOOL YEAR, OUR AVERAGE WAS A COMPOSITE SCORE OF 16. THESE SCORES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW WHERE
 OUR STUDENTS SHOULD BE IN ORDER TO TAKE NON-REMEDIAL CLASSES AND BE SET UP FOR LONG-TERM COLLEGE
 SUCCESS. THERE ARE ECONOMIC AND PERSISTENCE RAMIFICATIONS TO ENTERING COLLEGE WITHOUT THE CORE
 ACADEMICS NECESSARY TO AVOID REMEDIATION. BECAUSE REMEDIATION COURSES TYPICALLY EARN NO CREDITS,
 STUDENTS WHO TAKE THEM ARE PUT IN THE POSITION TO STAY IN SCHOOL LONGER (AND THUS PAY MORE) IN ORDER
 TO EARN A COLLEGE DEGREE. THIS IS A HUGE DISINCENTIVE FOR LOW-INCOME STUDENTS TO PERSIST. ACCORDING TO
 THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR EDUCATION STATISTICS (2007), ONLY 29% OF STUDENTS ENROLLED IN ONE OR TWO
 REMEDIAL ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS (ELA) AND/OR MATH COURSES END UP COMPLETING BACHELOR'S DEGREES
 WITHIN EIGHT YEARS. STUDENTS ENROLLED IN FOUR OR MORE REMEDIAL ELA AND/OR MATH COURSES HAVE A 19%
 CHANCE OF GRADUATING (4). 
 
 WHILE THE ACT® IS ONLY TAKEN IN HIGH SCHOOL, WE ARE ABLE TO SEE EVIDENCE OF THIS PROBLEM ACROSS OUR K-
 12 NETWORK BY ANALYZING OUR STUDENTS' MEASURES OF ACADEMIC PROGRESS® (MAP®) TEST SCORES. THE
 MAP® IS A NATIONALLY NORMED COMPUTER ADAPTIVE TEST THAT MEASURES INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS' PROGRESS AND
 GROWTH FROM KINDERGARTEN TO ELEVENTH GRADE. THE NORTHWEST EVALUATION ASSOCIATION (NWEA)
 CONDUCTED A LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF STUDENTS WHO HAD TAKEN THE MAP® FROM THIRD TO ELEVENTH GRADE,
 AND THEN SAT FOR THE ACT® ASSESSMENT (5). THIS STUDY CONNECTS MAP® DATA TO THE RAUSCH INTERVAL
 UNIT (RIT) SCALE WHICH CAN BE CORRELATED TO ACT LEVELS. THROUGH THIS STUDY, WE DEDUCED THAT IT IS
 POSSIBLE TO PROJECT COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS WITH OUR STUDENTS' MAP® DATA. THIS DATA SHOWS US
 THAT MANY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE NOT ON-TRACK TO BE COLLEGE READY BY THE TIME THEY ARE IN ELEVENTH GRADE.
 BASED ON 2013-14 ELA MAP® SCORES, 34% OF STUDENTS COMPLETING 4TH GRADE WITH KIPP NEW JERSEY
 ARE OFF-TRACK, 45% OF STUDENTS COMPLETING 8TH GRADE ARE OFF-TRACK, AND BY THE TIME THEY REACH 10TH
 GRADE, THE LAST YEAR BEFORE THEY TAKE THEIR ACT®, ALMOST 50% ARE NOT ON-TRACK TO BE COLLEGE-READY AS
 DEFINED BY SCORING A 21 ON THE ACT®. THESE NUMBERS ARE COMPARABLE WHEN LOOKING AT MATH MAP®
 SCORES. 
 
 IN ORDER FOR KIPP NEW JERSEY TO BETTER PREPARE OUR STUDENTS FOR LONG-TERM SUCCESS, WE MUST PROVIDE

 NARRATIVES
 ADDITIONAL, INDIVIDUALIZED SUPPORT TO STUDENTS PERFORMING BELOW THE BENCHMARK. AMERICORPS
 VOLUNTEERS WILL HELP BRIDGE THIS GAP BY CONDUCTING SMALL-GROUP REMEDIATION, REDUCING STUDENT-TEACHER
 RATIO IN THE KEY CONTENT AREAS OF ELA AND MATH, AND PROVIDING ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR SCHOOL-WIDE
 INITIATIVES AND PROJECTS. AMERICORPS RESIDENTS WILL WORK WITH APPROXIMATELY 165 KIPP NEW JERSEY
 STUDENTS. KIPP NEW JERSEY WILL CREATE A STUDENT CANDIDATE POOL CONSISTING OF STUDENTS WHO ARE AT-RISK
 ACADEMICALLY (PERFORMING IN THE BOTTOM TWO QUARTILES OF MAP® ACHIEVEMENT AND READING BELOW
 GRADE LEVEL AS ASCERTAINED BY FOUNTAS & PINNELL AND STEP DATA). 
 
 B2: THEORY OF CHANGE AND LOGIC MODEL
 
 KIPP NEW JERSEY SCHOOLS ARE FREE, OPEN-ENROLLMENT, COLLEGE-PREPARATORY PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS
 PREPARING STUDENTS IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES IN NEWARK AND CAMDEN, NEW JERSEY FOR SUCCESS IN
 COLLEGE AND IN LIFE. KIPP NEW JERSEY WAS FOUNDED IN 2002 WITH A SINGLE CLASS OF 80 FIFTH GRADERS AND
 HAS GROWN TO SERVE OVER 2,800 STUDENTS IN THE 2014-15 SCHOOL YEAR AT EIGHT SCHOOLS IN GRADES K-12. WE
 ALSO SERVE OVER 500 ALUMNI FOR WHOM WE PROVIDE COLLEGE COUNSELING AND SUPPORT SERVICES. THE VAST
 MAJORITY (91%) OF KIPP NEW JERSEY STUDENTS IN NEWARK ARE AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND IN CAMDEN ARE
 AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND LATINO (51% AND 47% RESPECTIVELY). 87% OF NEWARK STUDENTS QUALIFY FOR FREE OR
 REDUCED LUNCH AND 100% OF CAMDEN STUDENTS QUALIFY FOR FREE LUNCH. SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS MAKE
 UP OVER 13% OF OUR STUDENT BODY. THE NEIGHBORHOODS KIPP NEW JERSEY SERVES IN NEWARK AND
 CAMDEN ARE AMONG THE LOWEST PERFORMING IN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY. THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP IN THE
 COMMUNITIES WE SERVE HAS PERSISTED AT HIGH LEVELS FOR DECADES.
 
 KIPP NEW JERSEY'S MISSION IS TO DOUBLE THE GRADUATION RATE IN NEWARK AND TRIPLE IT IN CAMDEN. KIPP
 NEW JERSEY STUDENTS ENTER OUR NETWORK SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW GRADE LEVEL AND ARE NOT ALL MAKING THE
 GAINS NEEDED TO LEAVE OUR NETWORK COLLEGE-READY DUE TO THE IMMENSITY OF THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. THIS IS
 EVIDENCED BY KIPP NEW JERSEY'S AVERAGE ACT® SCORE AND NETWORK-WIDE MAP® DATA. OUR HIGHEST
 SCORING GRADUATING CLASS (2013-14) TO DATE SCORED AN AVERAGE ACT® COMPOSITE SCORE OF 19, WHICH IS
 BELOW THE MINIMUM ACT® COLLEGE READINESS ASSESSMENT COMPOSITE SCORE OF 21 RECOMMENDED FOR
 STUDENTS TO HAVE A HIGH PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS IN CREDIT-BEARING COLLEGE COURSES (6). KIPP NEW JERSEY'S
 2014-15 GRADUATING CLASS'S AVERAGE COMPOSITE ACT® SCORE WAS A 16. MOREOVER, WE SEE EVIDENCE OF
 THIS DEFICIT IN ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE GRADES BY ANALYZING OUR STUDENTS' MAP® SCORES. OF THE STUDENTS
 WHO COMPLETE 4TH GRADE WITH KIPP NEW JERSEY, 34% OF STUDENTS ARE NOT ON-TRACK TO BE COLLEGE-READY

 IN ELA AND 24% ARE NOT ON-TRACK IN MATH. OF THE STUDENTS WHO COMPLETE 8TH GRADE WITH KIPP NEW
 JERSEY, 45% ARE NOT ON-TRACK TO BE COLLEGE-READY IN ELA, AND 40% ARE NOT ON TRACK IN MATH. 
 
 TO ENSURE ALL KIPP NEW JERSEY STUDENTS ARE ON-TRACK TO BEING COLLEGE READY, WE MUST PROVIDE MORE
 INDIVIDUALIZED REMEDIATION AND SMALL GROUP INSTRUCTION. THIS WILL ULTIMATELY OPEN NEW DOORS FOR THE
 STUDENTS OF NEWARK AND CAMDEN. THE KIPP NEW JERSEY AMERICORPS RESIDENT PROGRAM HAS BEEN
 CAREFULLY DESIGNED IN ORDER TO SUPPORT NEWARK AND CAMDEN STUDENTS WITH OUTLYING ACADEMIC NEEDS
 WHILE ALSO INVESTING AND TRAINING A COHORT OF EAGER, SERVICE-MINDED COLLEGE-GRADUATES IN PROVIDING
 WORLD-CLASS EDUCATION TO UNDER-SERVED COMMUNITIES. 
 
 KIPP NEW JERSEY WILL BRING ON 11 RESIDENTS OPERATING IN 8 SCHOOLS SERVING ROUGHLY 165 STUDENTS
 RANGING FROM 3RD TO 10TH GRADE WHO ARE BELOW THE BENCHMARK BASED ON MAP®, FOUNTAS & PINNELL,
 AND STEP DATA FROM SEPTEMBER 2015 THROUGH JUNE 2016 (1700+ HOURS PER RESIDENT). THESE RESIDENTS
 WILL BE SPLIT ACROSS KIPP NEW JERSEY'S EXISTING SCHOOLS AS FOLLOWS:
 
 * LIFE ACADEMY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - 2 RESIDENTS
 
 * SEEK ACADEMY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - 1 RESIDENT
 
 * THRIVE ACADEMY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - 2 RESIDENTS
 
 * SPARK ACADEMY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - 1 RESIDENT
 
 * REVOLUTION PRIMARY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - 1 RESIDENT
 
 * TEAM ACADEMY MIDDLE SCHOOL - 1 RESIDENT
 
 * RISE ACADEMY MIDDLE SCHOOL - 2 RESIDENTS
 
 * NEWARK COLLEGIATE ACADEMY HIGH SCHOOL - 1 RESIDENT
 
 EACH RESIDENT WILL PROVIDE INDIVIDUALIZED SMALL-GROUP INSTRUCTION AND SUPPORT TO ROUGHLY 15 STUDENTS
 WHO ARE NOT YET ON-TRACK TOWARDS COLLEGE READINESS. RESIDENT ACTIVITIES ARE DIVIDED INTO THREE
 COMPONENTS: 
 
 1) SMALL GROUP REMEDIATION. FOR ROUGHLY 2 HOURS A DAY, RESIDENTS WILL PULL STUDENTS PERFORMING BELOW
 GRADE LEVEL IN ORDER TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL REMEDIATION IN THE KEY AREAS OF ELA AND MATH. WORKING IN
 THIS CAPACITY BENEFITS BOTH RESIDENTS AND STUDENTS. RESIDENTS WILL BE TRAINED TO COLLECT, TRACK AND
 ANALYZE STUDENT DATA, AND TO USE CUTTING-EDGE REMEDIATION TACTICS TO ADDRESS THE DEFICITS. ONGOING
 TRAINING ON THESE SKILLS WILL BE PROVIDED BY THE PROGRAM SUPERVISOR, RESIDENT ADVISORS AND ADDITIONAL
 KIPP NEW JERSEY TEACHING AND LEADING STAFF. STUDENTS WILL BENEFIT BY RECEIVING HIGHLY INDIVIDUALIZED,
 DYNAMIC INSTRUCTION THAT REACHES THEM AT THEIR ACADEMIC LEVEL. BASED ON THEIR STUDENTS' NEEDS,

 NARRATIVES
 RESIDENTS MAY ENLIST ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING MEANS OF INTERVENTION:
 
 * LEVELED LITERACY INTERVENTION (FOUNTAS & PINNELL) IS A SCRIPTED, SMALL-GROUP LITERACY INTERVENTION
 DESIGNED TO HELP EDUCATORS PROVIDE POWERFUL, DAILY, SMALL-GROUP INSTRUCTION FOR THE LOWEST ACHIEVING
 STUDENTS AT THEIR GRADE LEVEL. THIS INTERVENTION USES A COMBINATION OF READING, WRITING AND
 PHONICS/WORD STUDY. 
 
 * GUIDED READING (FOUNTAS & PINNELL) IS SMALL GROUP READING INSTRUCTION DESIGNED TO PROVIDE
 DIFFERENTIATED TEACHING THAT SUPPORTS STUDENTS IN DEVELOPING READING PROFICIENCY.
 
 * ONE-ON-ONE TUTORIALS ALLOW RESIDENTS TO WORK WITH OUR MOST OUTLYING LEARNERS TO PRE-TEACH AND RETEACH
 CONCEPTS THAT ARE CAUSING STRUGGLE IN THE CLASSROOM.
 
 * FASTT MATH (SCHOLASTIC) IS A BLENDED LEARNING MATH PROGRAM DESIGNED TO BUILD FLUENCY AND
 AUTOMATICITY. RESIDENTS WILL FACILITATE THIS ACTIVITY FOR 10 MINUTES EVERY DAY AS NEEDED. 
 
 * ACCELERATED READER (RENAISSANCE LEARNING) IS A BLENDED-LEARNING PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS EDUCATORS TO
 MONITOR AND TRACK STUDENT'S INDEPENDENT READING PRACTICES. RESIDENTS WILL TRACK STUDENT DATA AND USE
 TO INFORM FURTHER INTERVENTION PLANNING. THIS DATA WILL BE TRACKED ON RESIDENTS' DASHBOARDS AND WILL BE
 USED TO MONITOR RESIDENTS' INTERVENTION EFFORTS. 
 
 * ST MATH (MIND RESEARCH INSTITUTE) IS GAME-BASED INSTRUCTIONAL SOFTWARE FOR K-12 THAT IS DESIGNED
 TO BOOST MATH COMPREHENSION AND PROFICIENCY THROUGH VISUAL LEARNING. RESIDENTS WILL TRACK STUDENT
 DATA AND USE TO INFORM FURTHER INTERVENTION PLANNING. THIS DATA WILL BE TRACKED ON RESIDENTS'
 DASHBOARDS AND WILL BE USED TO MONITOR RESIDENTS' INTERVENTION EFFORTS. 
 
 2.) CLASSROOM ASSISTANCE. FOR ROUGHLY 2 HOURS A DAY, RESIDENTS WILL WORK DIRECTLY WITHIN AN ELA
 AND/OR MATH CLASSROOM IN A TEACHING ASSISTANT CAPACITY. THIS EXPERIENCE PROVIDES BENEFITS FOR BOTH
 RESIDENTS AND STUDENTS. BECAUSE RESIDENTS WILL BE WORKING ALONGSIDE CLASSROOM TEACHERS, THE STUDENTTEACHER
 RATIO WILL BE REDUCED FROM ROUGHLY 30:1 TO 15:1 ON AVERAGE DURING ELA AND/OR MATH BLOCKS.
 THIS BENEFITS OUR STUDENTS BECAUSE IT WILL ALLOW STRUGGLING STUDENTS TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL/REMEDIATED
 INSTRUCTION AS NEEDED. THIS EXPOSURE TO BEST-TEACHING PRACTICES WILL PROVIDE A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR
 RESIDENTS SHOULD THEY CHOOSE TO TEACH OR WORK IN EDUCATION PAST THEIR SERVICE YEAR. 
 
 3.) SPECIAL PROJECT SUPPORT. FOR ROUGHLY 2 HOURS A DAY, RESIDENTS WILL SUPPORT INITIATIVES WITHIN THE
 SCHOOL (ACADEMIC AND NON-ACADEMIC). THESE INITIATIVES COULD INCLUDE (BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO) THE
 FOLLOWING: AFTER SCHOOL CLUBS AND SPORTS, ADDITIONAL TUTORING, OUR KIPP THROUGH COLLEGE INITIATIVES,
 SCHOOL MUSICALS, SCHOOL-WIDE SYSTEM INNOVATION AND UPKEEP, OPERATIONAL SUPPORT, DATA SUPPORT, ETC.
 RESIDENTS WILL BUILD UPON THEIR INDIVIDUAL STRENGTHS AND INTERESTS IN ORDER TO MOTIVATE STUDENTS TO EXCEL
 BOTH IN AND OUT OF THE CLASSROOM.

 B3: EVIDENCE BASE
 
 KIPP NEW JERSEY'S MISSION IS TO DOUBLE THE GRADUATION RATE OF NEWARK AND TRIPLE THE GRADUATION RATE
 OF CAMDEN, NEW JERSEY. THIS GOAL IS NOT AN ARBITRARY ONE. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT A FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE
 GRADUATES EARN $900,000 MORE OVER A LIFETIME THAN HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES WITHOUT ANY POSTSECONDARY
 EDUCATION (7). IN ORDER TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF POVERTY IN OUR NATIONS, MOST HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED
 COMMUNITIES, THE ABILITY TO NOT ONLY GET INTO, BUT COMPLETE COLLEGE MUST BE OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY. THE
 KIPP NEW JERSEY AMERICORPS RESIDENT PROGRAM WAS CREATED TO PROVIDE THE ADDITIONAL REMEDIATION
 NEEDED TO GET OUR UNDERPERFORMING STUDENTS PREPARED TO NOT ONLY ENTER, BUT COMPLETE COLLEGE. IN ORDER
 TO DESIGN THE PROGRAM THAT WILL BENEFIT OUR KIDS MOST, WE DID EXTENSIVE RESEARCH OF STUDIES AND
 COMPARABLE APPROACHES. FIRST, WE FOUND ABUNDANT EVIDENCE THAT TUTORING LEADS TO POSITIVE OUTCOMES
 FOR STUDENTS. FOR INSTANCE, DURING THE 2013-14 ACADEMIC YEAR, THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO'S URBAN
 EDUCATION LAB (UEL) MONITORED A GROUP OF STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN INDIVIDUALIZED TWO-ON-ONE
 MATH INSTRUCTION FOR AN HOUR A DAY, EVERY DAY DESIGNED TO HELP STUDENTS MEET GRADE LEVEL AND INCREASE
 THE LIKELIHOOD OF PASSING REQUIRED MATH COURSES FOR GRADUATION. AFTER JUST SIX MONTHS THEIR DATA
 SHOWED:
 
 * IMPROVED STUDENT MATH TEST SCORES BY THE EQUIVALENT OF ABOUT THREE YEARS OF LEARNING FOR THE TYPICAL
 AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT;
 
 * IMPROVED MATH GRADES EQUAL TO 0.6 POINTS ON A 4-POINT SCALE;
 
 * REDUCED COURSE FAILURES BY 57% (2 FEWER COURSES FAILED PER YEAR);
 
 * INCREASED SCHOOL ATTENDANCE (2.5 WEEKS MORE SCHOOL ATTENDED PER YEAR);
 
 * AND INCREASED BY NEARLY 50% THE LIKELIHOOD THAT YOUTH ARE ON-TRACK FOR GRADUATION ACCORDING TO THE
 CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOLS DEFINITION FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS (8)
 
 RESEARCH ALSO SHOWED US THAT SUCCESSFUL TUTORING PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE ONE DESCRIBED SHARE SEVERAL
 COMMON FEATURES. THESE INCLUDE PROVIDING ONGOING TRAINING TO TUTORS, TRACKING ONGOING FORMATIVE
 ASSESSMENTS AS A MEANS TO GUIDE THE REMEDIATION PROCESS, REQUIRING COLLABORATION WITH EXPERIENCED
 CLASSROOM TEACHERS, AND CAREFUL SCREENING AND SELECTION CRITERIA FOR TUTORS (9). IT WAS WITH THIS IN
 MIND THAT THE KIPP NEW JERSEY AMERICORPS RESIDENT PROGRAM WAS STRUCTURED WITH SUCH INTENSE

 NARRATIVES
 SUPPORTS AND ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES IN PLACE FOR RESIDENTS. 
 
 WHILE THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF TUTORING PROGRAMS THAT HAVE YIELDED GREAT GAINS FOR
 STUDENTS FROM LOW-INCOME BACKGROUNDS IN RECENT YEARS, BLUE ENGINE, AN AMERICORPS FUNDED TUTORING
 PROGRAM IN NEW YORK CITY, PROVIDES PERHAPS THE MOST COMPELLING EVIDENCE OF THE BENEFITS THAT
 PURPOSEFUL AND STRUCTURED TUTORING CAN PROVIDE OUR STUDENTS. BLUE ENGINE SERVES A POPULATION WITH
 DEMOGRAPHICS SIMILAR TO THOSE OF KIPP NEW JERSEY. 96% OF THE STUDENT BODY THAT BLUE ENGINE SERVES
 QUALIFIES FOR FREE OR REDUCED LUNCH AND 94% ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN OR LATINO (10). SIMILARLY, 87% OF
 KIPP NEW JERSEY STUDENTS QUALIFY FOR FREE OR REDUCED LUNCH AND 98% ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN OR LATINO
 (11). BLUE ENGINE ALSO PROVIDES SIMILAR INTERVENTIONS TO THE ONES WE ARE PROPOSING AT KIPP NEW
 JERSEY, WHEREIN RECENT COLLEGE GRADUATES SPEND A YEAR OF SERVICE PROVIDING SMALL GROUP AND ONE-ONONE
 TUTORING SUPPORT, AS WELL AS PROVIDING ADDITIONAL SCHOOL-WIDE SUPPORT OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM
 (12). CLASSROOMS SUPPORTED BY BLUE ENGINE TUTORS ACHIEVED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN COLLEGE READINESS
 BETWEEN 2010 AND 2014. ON THE JUNE 2011 NY STATE EXAM, 43% OF 9TH GRADERS DEMONSTRATED COLLEGEREADY
 MATH SKILLS (MEASURED BY SCORES OF 80+ ON THE EXAM). THIS NUMBER IS NEARLY TRIPLE THE NUMBER
 FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, WHEN BLUE ENGINE WAS NOT THERE TO SUPPORT. BY 2014, THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS
 SCORING COLLEGE READY SCORES ON THE COMMON CORE ALIGNED EXAM (ACROSS BOTH ELA AND MATH) INCREASED
 BY 73% (13). FOR LOW-INCOME STUDENTS WITH OUTLYING ACADEMIC NEEDS, INTENSE, PURPOSEFUL TUTORING CAN
 BE A GAME-CHANGER WHEN AIMING AT COLLEGE-READINESS. 
 
 ONE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BLUE ENGINE'S PROGRAM MODEL AND KIPP NEW JERSEY'S IS THE AGE OF THE
 POPULATION SERVED. BLUE ENGINE HAS CHOSEN TO FOCUS ON TUTORING AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL EXCLUSIVELY.
 KIPP NEW JERSEY PLANS TO REMEDIATE AT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND MIDDLE SCHOOL LEVEL, AS WELL AS THE
 HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL, FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS. STUDIES SHOW THAT A SIGNIFICANT INDICATOR OF COLLEGE
 READINESS IS THE ABILITY TO TAKE COLLEGE-PREPARATORY CLASSES IN HIGH SCHOOL. STUDIES CONDUCTED BY THE
 DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAVE FOUND THAT ""A RIGOROUS HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM HAS A GREATER IMPACT ON
 BACHELOR'S DEGREE COMPLETION THAN ANY OTHER PRE-COLLEGE INDICATOR OF ACADEMIC PREPARATION"" (14).
 CURRENTLY, ROUGHLY 45% PERCENT OF KIPP NEW JERSEY STUDENTS REQUIRE SOME FORM OF REMEDIATION
 COURSES IN HIGH SCHOOL. IN ORDER TO CORRECT THIS, WE ARE PLACING EMPHASIS ON GETTING OUR STUDENTS ON A
 COLLEGE-READY TRACK BEFORE THEY ENTER OUR HIGH SCHOOL.
 
 IT IS IMPORTANT TO KIPP NEW JERSEY THAT WE ACCURATELY ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF OUR PROGRAM. AS
 PAGE 10
 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
 NARRATIVES
 EXPLAINED FURTHER IN THIS GRANT, WE WILL BE PUTTING SYSTEMS IN PLACE FOR RESIDENTS, RESIDENT ADVISORS, THE
 PROGRAM SUPERVISOR AND AMERICORPS PERSONNEL TO ASSESS TUTOR AND STUDENT PROGRESS AT ANY TIME.
 FURTHERMORE, IN ORDER TO GAUGE THE OVERALL EFFICACY OF OUR WORK, WE WILL COMPARE THE GROWTH MADE BY
 STUDENTS WHO RECEIVE AMERICORPS TUTORING WITH STUDENTS WHO DO NOT RECEIVE AMERICORPS TUTORING.
 BOTH GROUPS WILL BE COMPRISED OF STUDENTS WHO MEET OUR ENTRY CRITERIA - BEING ACADEMICALLY AT RISK
 BASED ON MAP®, FOUNTAS AND PINNELL AND STEP ASSESSMENT DATA. AFTER 1 YEAR OF THE PROGRAM WE WILL
 LOOK AT THE GAINS FOR BOTH GROUPS BASED ON MAP® ASSESSMENTS. IN THIS WAY, WE WILL BE ABLE TO
 CONCLUDE THAT THE RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN THE DECIDING FORCE IN OUR STUDENTS' POSITIVE OUTCOMES.
 
 B4: NOTICE PRIORITY 
 
 KIPP NEW JERSEY IS REQUESTING AMERICORPS FUNDING SUPPORT TO IMPROVE THE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES FOR
 ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN AND SUPPORT ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS TO PREPARE FOR
 SUCCESS IN POST-SECONDARY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. IN NEWARK, 87% OF STUDENTS WE SERVE ARE ELIGIBLE
 FOR FREE OR REDUCED LUNCH AND 100% OF OUR STUDENTS IN CAMDEN ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE LUNCH. KIPP NEW
 JERSEY BELIEVES THAT ONE DAY, OUR NATION WILL KNOW NEWARK AND CAMDEN, NEW JERSEY, AS CITIES OF
 WORLD-CLASS PUBLIC EDUCATION. THE KIPP NEW JERSEY AMERICORPS RESIDENT PROGRAM AIMS TO IMPROVE
 THE LIVES OF OUR STUDENTS BY PROVIDING THE REMEDIATION THEY NEED TO BE COLLEGE READY BY THE END OF HIGH
 SCHOOL. THE PROGRAM ALSO AIMS TO STRENGTHEN OUR COMMUNITIES BY PROVIDING THIS SERVICE AND TRAINING
 OPPORTUNITY TO NEWARK AND CAMDEN RESIDENTS. THEY WILL RECEIVE TRAINING AND GRADUATE CREDIT FROM
 RELAY GRADUATE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, WHICH WILL PREPARE THEM TO PERSIST IN THE FIELD OF EDUCATION
 BEYOND THEIR SERVICE YEAR. THE PROGRAM GIVES CIVIC-MINDED INDIVIDUALS THE CHANCE TO HAVE A
 MEASURABLE IMPACT ON THE LIVES OF LOW-INCOME STUDENTS. 
 
 B5: MEMBER TRAINING 
 
 TRAINING THE INDIVIDUALS DIRECTLY SERVING OUR STUDENTS HAS ALWAYS BEEN A HUGE PRIORITY FOR KIPP NEW
 JERSEY, AND THUS EXTENSIVE RESOURCES HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED TO ENSURE THAT RESIDENTS ARE PREPARED TO GIVE
 STUDENTS THE ACADEMIC SUPPORT THEY NEED. THE THREE MAIN COMPONENTS OF HIGH QUALITY MEMBER
 TRAINING COME IN THE FORMS OF 1) PROGRAM SUPERVISOR 2) SITE-BASED RESIDENT ADVISORS AND 3) RELAY
 GRADUATE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION. TRAINING AND SUPERVISION FOR RESIDENTS WILL BE INTERRELATED. 
 
 PAGE 11
 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
 NARRATIVES
 THE PROGRAM SUPERVISOR IS A FULL-TIME KIPP NEW JERSEY EMPLOYEE WHO WILL SPEND 75% OF HER TIME
 OVERSEEING THIS PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM SUPERVISOR WILL PARTICIPATE IN AMERICORPS TRAININGS AND THEN
 PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SESSIONS WITH THE RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS (SCHOOL LEADERS, RESIDENT
 ADVISORS, RESIDENTS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT) IN ORDER TO TURNKEY THIS INFORMATION. THE PROGRAM
 SUPERVISOR WILL PROVIDE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR, MID-YEAR, AND END OF YEAR TRAINING FOR RESIDENTS AND
 RESIDENT ADVISORS ON AMERICORPS'S MISSION, REGULATIONS AND UPDATES. THE PROGRAM SUPERVISOR WILL
 PROVIDE A FULL LIST OF THE PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES THE CORPORATION PUBLISHED IN AUGUST 2002 AT THESE
 TRAINING SESSIONS SO MEMBERS ARE FULLY AWARE OF WHAT THE REGULATIONS STATE REGARDING ACTIVITIES
 MEMBERS ARE PROHIBITED FROM DOING. ADDITIONALLY, THE PROGRAM SUPERVISOR WILL MEET WITH RESIDENT
 ADVISORS AND RESIDENTS AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH FOR AN HOUR TO MONITOR STUDENT ACADEMIC PROGRESS,
 RESIDENTS' GROWTH, AND THE OVERALL FUNCTIONALITY OF THE PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM SUPERVISOR ALSO
 COMPLETES FORMAL EVALUATIONS (OR GATEWAYS) ALONG WITH RELAY GRADUATE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION
 PROFESSIONALS, COORDINATES ALL PROGRAMMATIC EVENTS (INCLUDING AMERICORPS DAYS OF SERVICE AND EVENTS
 WITH PARTNERING ORGANIZATIONS), AND ACTS AS A LIAISON BETWEEN RELAY GRADUATE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION AND
 OUR RESIDENTS AND RESIDENT ADVISORS. THE PROGRAM SUPERVISOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COMPILATION OF ALL
 COMPLIANCE PAPERWORK AND REPORTING REQUIRED BY AMERICORPS. FINALLY, THE PROGRAM SUPERVISOR
 CREATES AND EXECUTES RESIDENT IMPROVEMENT PLANS AND TERMINATIONS (IF NEEDED).
 
 RESIDENTS WILL BE SUPPORTED DAILY BY A RESIDENT ADVISOR AT EACH SCHOOL SITE. RESIDENT ADVISORS WILL
 HAVE MORE THAN ONE YEAR OF TEACHING WITH KIPP NEW JERSEY, DEMONSTRATE A CLEAR RECORD OF SUCCESS
 WORKING WITH STUDENTS, SHOW STRONG CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT SKILLS, BE ASPIRING INSTRUCTIONAL LEADERS,
 HAVE THE CAPACITY TO MANAGE ONE RESIDENT, AND BE AN ELA OR MATH TEACHER. WHILE NOT REQUIRED, THE
 PROGRAM SUPERVISOR WILL BE LOOKING FOR RESIDENT ADVISOR CANDIDATES WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE WORKING
 WITH AMERICORPS MEMBERS AND RELAY STUDENTS. THE RESIDENT ADVISOR WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING
 WEEKLY LESSON PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT FEEDBACK TO THE RESIDENT, AS WELL AS GUIDING THE RESIDENT
 THROUGH THE SYSTEMS AND CULTURE OF HIS OR HER SCHOOL. RESIDENT ADVISORS WILL HAVE RECEIVED
 AMERICORPS TRAINING FROM THE PROGRAM SUPERVISOR, AND THUS WILL BE PREPARED TO SUPPORT RESIDENTS IN
 ADHERING TO AMERICORPS EXPECTATIONS. RESIDENT ADVISORS WILL BE EQUIPPED WITH A WRITTEN OVERVIEW OF
 AMERICORPS EXPECTATIONS, AND WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM SUPERVISOR SHOULD ANY QUESTIONS ARISE.
 RESIDENTS WILL PARTICIPATE IN WEEKLY CHECK-INS WITH THE RESIDENT ADVISOR, MONTHLY CHECK-INS WITH
 PROGRAM SUPERVISORS, SCHOOL-WIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, AND NETWORK PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
 THREE TIMES PER YEAR.

 NARRATIVES
 ANOTHER KEY COMPONENT OF RESIDENT TRAINING COMES IN THE FORM OF RELAY GRADUATE SCHOOL OF
 EDUCATION, WHERE ALL RESIDENTS WILL BE ENROLLED. THROUGH THEIR WORK WITH RELAY, RESIDENTS WILL RECEIVE
 EXTENSIVE WEEKLY TRAINING AND DELIBERATE PRACTICE IN PROVEN, HIGHLY EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNIQUES.
 DURING THE PROGRAM, RESIDENTS WILL LEARN WHAT IT TAKES TO HAVE HIGH-EXPECTATIONS, AND BE A DATADRIVEN,
 STRATEGIC EDUCATOR. RELAY WILL PROVIDE 3 SCHOOL DAY HOURS PER WEEK, 2 WEEKNIGHTS AND 1
 SATURDAY PER MONTH OF IN-PERSON TRAINING. ADDITIONALLY, RELAY GRADUATE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION
 PROFESSORS WILL OBSERVE RESIDENTS TEACHING IN ONE-ON-ONE AND SMALL GROUPS AND PROVIDE CONSTRUCTIVE
 FEEDBACK ONCE A MONTH. RESIDENTS WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE SOME ONLINE TRAINING MODULES FOR
 THEIR RELAY GRADUATE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION WORKLOAD. IN COOPERATION WITH RELAY, RESIDENTS WILL HAVE
 SEVERAL SET EVALUATIONS OR 'GATEWAYS' ASSESSING THEIR GROWTH AS TUTORS AND CONTRIBUTORS TO OUR STUDENTS'
 ACHIEVEMENT. THE GATEWAYS AND ASSOCIATED SKILLS ARE AS FOLLOWS:
 
 * GATEWAY #1 (SEPTEMBER) - MINDSETS AND PROFESSIONALISM: RESIDENTS WILL DEMONSTRATE KEY MINDSETS
 OF HIGH EXPECTATIONS, PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY, CONTINUING IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS, AS WELL AS
 PROFESSIONALISM STANDARDS. 
 
 * GATEWAY #2 (OCTOBER) - MANAGEMENT SIMULATION: RESIDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO MANAGE SMALL GROUP
 BEHAVIOR BY APPLYING TECHNIQUES TO ENSURE POSITIVE MOMENTUM AND LEARNING. 
 
 * GATEWAY #3 (DECEMBER) - OPENING A LESSON: RESIDENTS MUST PROVE THAT THEY CAN TEACH THE OPENING
 OF A LESSON AND THE INTRODUCTION TO NEW MATERIAL. 
 
 * GATEWAY #4 (MARCH) - TEACHING A FULL LESSON: RESIDENTS WILL SUBMIT A FULL LESSON VIDEO AND BE
 OBSERVED TEACHING A LESSON IN THEIR SCHOOLS TO DETERMINE THEIR READINESS FOR THE INCREASED ON RAMP INTO
 TEACHING IN MAY AND ABILITY TO RUN A CLASSROOM THE FOLLOWING YEAR. 
 
 IF, AT THE COMPLETION OF THEIR SERVICE YEAR, RESIDENTS ARE INTERESTED IN PURSUING A TEACHING POSITION WITH
 KIPP NEW JERSEY OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL, THEY MAY OPT INTO A FINAL GATEWAY.
 
 * GATEWAY #5 (MAY) FULL TIME TEACHING PLACEMENT: IN CONJUNCTION WITH PARTNER SCHOOLS, RESIDENTS
 WILL BE ASSESSED FOR THEIR READINESS OF BECOMING FULL-TIME TEACHERS. 
 
 GATEWAY #5 IS NOT A REQUIREMENT OF THE PROGRAM.
 
 B6: MEMBER SUPERVISION 
 
 MEAGHAN BERTSCH WILL SERVE AS THE FOUNDING KIPP NEW JERSEY'S AMERICORPS PROGRAM SUPERVISOR.
 MEAGHAN WAS A TEACH FOR AMERICA CORPS MEMBER IN 2006 TEACHING ALL LEVELS OF HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH
 PAGE 13
 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
 NARRATIVES
 IN NEWARK FOR THREE YEARS AT A COMPREHENSIVE HIGH SCHOOL. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS AT HER HIGH SCHOOL,
 MEAGHAN LOBBIED FOR AND IMPLEMENTED AN INTERVENTION PROGRAM FOR ESL AND STRUGGLING READERS IN HER
 SCHOOL, WHICH RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT GAINS FOR HER UNDER PERFORMING STUDENTS. IN 2009 SHE JOINED
 TEAM ACADEMY, A KIPP NEW JERSEY MIDDLE SCHOOL, AS AN 8TH GRADE READING TEACHER. HER 8TH GRADE
 STUDENTS SCORED 92% PROFICIENT OR ADVANCED PROFICIENT ON THE NJASK IN 2010. IN 2011, MEAGHAN
 MOVED TO THE RECRUITMENT TEAM OF THE CENTRAL OFFICE WHERE SHE OVERSAW SECONDARY RECRUITMENT AND
 NETWORK PARTNERSHIPS. SHE HAS LED PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SESSIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ON
 INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICES FOR NEW TEACHERS AND WORKED FOR TEACH FOR AMERICA'S SUMMER INSTITUTE. FOR
 THE 2015-16 SCHOOL YEAR, HER ROLE WILL FOCUS ON PIPELINE DEVELOPMENT, WHERE SHE WILL GENERATE NEW
 TALENT PIPELINES THROUGH STUDENT-TEACHER PARTNERSHIPS, INTERNSHIPS, AND BROADENING KIPP NEW JERSEY'S
 UNIVERSITY PARTNERSHIPS. 
 
 AS THE FOUNDING PROJECT SUPERVISOR FOR KIPP NEW JERSEY'S AMERICORPS PROGRAM, MEAGHAN WILL
 PARTICIPATE IN AMERICORPS MANAGER TRAINING IN AUGUST 2015 AND MONTHLY CONFERENCE CALLS OR MEETINGS
 FOR CONTINUED TRAINING. THROUGH THE MANAGER TRAINING, MONTHLY MEETINGS, AND COLLABORATION WITH
 OTHER PROGRAM MANAGERS, MEAGHAN WILL FULLY UNDERSTAND THE AMERICORPS EXPECTATIONS TO IMPLEMENT
 OUR PROGRAM AND BE PREPARED TO TRAIN OUR RESIDENT ADVISORS AND RESIDENTS. 
 
 B7: MEMBER EXPERIENCE
 
 BECAUSE AMERICORPS RESIDENTS WILL BE GOING THROUGH RELAY GRADUATE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, AND
 BECAUSE THERE ARE SEVERAL LAYERS OF TRAINING AND SUPPORT BUILT INTO THE PROGRAM, THEY WILL BE ABLE TO
 WALK AWAY FROM THEIR YEAR OF SERVICE WITH REAL-WORLD TEACHING AND SKILLS THAT WILL MAKE THEM HIGHLY
 MARKETABLE IN THE EDUCATION JOB MARKET. RESIDENTS WILL COMPLETE THEIR SERVICE YEAR WITH EXPERIENCE
 WORKING IN AN URBAN SCHOOL SETTING, LEADING SMALL GROUP INSTRUCTION, HAVING OPPORTUNITIES TO TAKE ON
 LEADERSHIP ROLES IN SPECIAL PROJECTS FOR THEIR SCHOOL, AND VOLUNTEERING WITH SEVERAL SERVICE PROJECTS IN
 THEIR COMMUNITIES. RESIDENTS WILL HAVE THE OPTION TO APPLY FOR A FULL-TIME TEACHING POSITION (WITH
 KIPP NEW JERSEY OR ELSEWHERE, ASSUMING THE ORGANIZATION IS WILLING TO HIRE ALTERNATE ROUTE TEACHING
 CANDIDATES) THE YEAR AFTER THEIR SERVICE YEAR AND/OR CONTINUE WORKING WITH RELAY TO OBTAIN THEIR
 MASTERS IN EDUCATION. RESIDENTS WILL BE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO CONTINUE WORKING WITHIN THE NEWARK
 AND/OR CAMDEN COMMUNITIES IN SOME CAPACITY AFTER THEIR SERVICE YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, ALL RESIDENTS WILL
 BE ENCOURAGED TO STAY CONNECTED TO KIPP NEW JERSEY THROUGH SEVERAL ANNUAL ALUMNI NEWSLETTERS AND
 PAGE 14
 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
 NARRATIVES
 ONE-OFF VOLUNTEERING OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN OUR NETWORK.
 
 AMERICORPS RESIDENTS WILL HAVE MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK WITH ONE ANOTHER AND FORM A COHORT.
 THOSE RESIDENTS WHO CHOOSE TO OPT INTO LIVING WITH THEIR FELLOW RESIDENTS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO
 LIVE AND WORK ALONGSIDE OTHER SERVICE MEMBERS IN THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY SERVE. BEYOND THAT,
 RESIDENTS WILL COME TOGETHER FOR MONTHLY MEETINGS IN ORDER TO DEVELOP AN INCLUSIVE SENSE OF
 COMMUNITY AND SUPPORT. AT MONTHLY MEETINGS, RESIDENTS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE PART IN
 DIVERSITY TRAINING, MINDSET COACHING, AND SELF-REFLECTION TO ENSURE THAT THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE
 RESIDENTS ACQUIRE SKILLS AND PERSPECTIVE.
 
 KIPP NEW JERSEY BELIEVES THAT FINDING SMART, DRIVEN, KID-FOCUSED STAFF IS CRUCIAL TO PROVIDING OUR
 STUDENTS WITH THE EDUCATION THEY DESERVE. THIS PHILOSOPHY WILL STAND TRUE WHEN WE RECRUIT RESIDENTS.
 WE WILL LOOK TO HIRE LARGELY FROM WITHIN THE NEWARK AND CAMDEN COMMUNITIES. WE WILL START BY
 REACHING OUT TO KIPP NEW JERSEY'S ALUMNI TO GAUGE INTEREST AND TO GARNER REFERRALS. WE WILL ALSO
 REACH OUT TO LONG-STANDING COMMUNITY PARTNERS (WIGHT FOUNDATION, NJ SEEDS, NJ LEEP, KIDS CORP)
 TO GAUGE INTEREST AND REAP REFERRALS. WE WILL ALSO CAPITALIZE ON OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL UNIVERSITIES
 (RUTGERS NEWARK, RUTGERS CAMDEN, RUTGERS NEW BRUNSWICK, KEAN UNIVERSITY, BLOOMFIELD UNIVERSITY,
 SETON HALL UNIVERSITY) IN ORDER TO RECRUIT HIGH CALIBER CANDIDATES. 
 
 B8: COMMITMENT TO AMERICORPS IDENTIFICATION
 
 KIPP NEW JERSEY STAFF AND STUDENTS WOULD BE PROUD TO PARTNER WITH AMERICORPS. MANY OF OUR STAFF
 MEMBERS ARE AMERICORP ALUMNI (CITY YEAR, TEACH FOR AMERICA, CITIZEN SCHOOLS), AND THUS ARE
 FAMILIAR WITH THE SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND PERSPECTIVE THAT TIME SPENT IN SERVICE CAN CREATE. THERE ARE
 SEVERAL WAYS THAT WE WILL ENSURE THAT OUR RESIDENTS VALUE THEIR IDENTITY AS AMERICORPS VOLUNTEERS.
 FIRST, RESIDENTS WILL LEARN ABOUT THE HISTORY AND PURPOSE OF AMERICORPS DURING THEIR INITIAL ORIENTATION
 SESSIONS. RESIDENTS WILL REPEAT THE PLEDGE, AND THAT PLEDGE WILL BE PROMINENTLY DISPLAYED DURING
 RESIDENT COHORT MEETINGS SO IT CAN BE REFERENCED AND REINFORCED. RESIDENTS WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO
 PROMINENTLY DISPLAY THE AMERICORPS LOGO DAILY. KIPP NEW JERSEY WILL BE PROVIDING OUTERWEAR AND
 BADGES TO ALL RESIDENTS, WHICH SHOULD BE WORN EVERY DAY TO REPRESENT THEIR AMERICORPS STANDING.
 MOREOVER, KIPP NEW JERSEY WILL MAKE SURE THAT AMERICORPS SIGNAGE IS PROMINENTLY PLACED IN THE
 CLASSROOMS WHERE RESIDENTS ARE TUTORING, AS WELL AS IN SHARED SPACE AT THE SCHOOL. THE AMERICORPS SEAL
 PAGE 15
 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
 NARRATIVES
 WILL BE REPRESENTED ON KIPP NEW JERSEY'S WEBSITE AND ALL MATERIALS BRANDED FOR THE PROGRAM
 (PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT MATERIALS, PROMOTIONAL PRODUCTS, ETC.).
 
 WE ARE FORTUNATE THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL AMERICORPS PARTNERS WORKING ALONGSIDE US IN OUR
 COMMUNITIES. IN NEWARK, TEACH FOR AMERICA, CITIZEN SCHOOLS, AND GREAT OAKS CHARTER SCHOOL ARE ALL
 DOING EXCELLENT WORK IN OUR CITY, AND WE WOULD LIKE TO PARTNER WITH THEM TO CREATE A COMMUNITY OF
 SERVICE-DRIVEN INDIVIDUALS INTERESTED IN MAKING A UNIFIED, POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE WORLD AROUND THEM.
 WE WILL HOLD SOCIAL FUNCTIONS EVERY OTHER MONTH, AS WELL AS AN END OF YEAR CELEBRATION TO RECOGNIZE
 ACCOMPLISHMENTS. KIPP NEW JERSEY AMERICORPS RESIDENTS WILL BE REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE
 FOLLOWING SERVICE PROJECTS:
 
 * MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. HOLIDAY 
 
 * AMERICORPS WEEK

 C1: ORGANIZATIONAL BACKGROUND AND STAFFING
 
 SINCE FOUNDING ITS FIRST MIDDLE SCHOOL IN 2002, KIPP NEW JERSEY HAS OPENED AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN
 SCHOOLS AND EXPANDED TO CAMDEN. WE DO NOT EXPAND OR OPEN MORE SCHOOLS WITHOUT IDENTIFYING THE
 LEADERSHIP AND TEACHING STAFF OF THE CALIBER WE NEED TO SERVE STUDENTS. TO SUPPORT IDENTIFYING TALENT
 AND CONTINUING TO GROW OUR SCHOOLS, KIPP NEW JERSEY HAS BUILT A STRONG CENTRAL OFFICE SUPPORT. OUR
 SCHOOL LEADERS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT ALL HAVE BETWEEN 5-12 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN TEACHING,
 EDUCATION, OR EDUCATION MANAGEMENT WITHIN OUR SCHOOLS. FOR THE 2014-15 SCHOOL YEAR, THREE OF OUR
 PRINCIPALS MOVED INTO NETWORK FACING ROLES TO SUPPORT OUR CONTINUED EXPANSION TO SERVE MORE STUDENTS.
 ENSURING WE SUCCESSFULLY SCALE IS A KEY PRIORITY FOR OUR NETWORK. IT'S CRUCIAL THAT WE CONSIDER HOW WE
 CAN EXPAND OUR TEACHER BASE AS FAST AS WE GROW OUR SCHOOLS. PART OF OUR RECRUITMENT TEAM'S GOALS FOR
 THE 2015-16 SCHOOL YEAR IS TO DEVELOP A TEACHER PIPELINE AND TRAINING PROGRAM. WORKING WITH
 AMERICORPS MEMBERS, WE CAN TAKE NOVICE EDUCATORS AND PROVIDE THE RESOURCES AND TRAINING THEY NEED
 TO PREPARE THEM TO MAKE AN IMPACT IN OUR COMMUNITIES AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THEIR SERVICE YEAR IF
 THEY ARE INTERESTED. OUR PROGRAM SUPERVISOR WILL SPEND 75% OF HER TIME MANAGING AND TRAINING OUR
 AMERICORPS MEMBERS SO THEY ARE PREPARED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS.

 KIPP NEW JERSEY IS CURRENTLY THE SUB RECIPIENT OF FOUR FEDERAL GRANTS THROUGH THE KIPP NATIONAL OFFICE
 AND A NEW JERSEY STATE RACE TO THE TOP GRANT. THESE GRANTS ARE ALL ADMINISTERED ON A COST
 REIMBURSEMENT BASIS. SINCE FOUNDING IN 2002, KIPP NEW JERSEY HAS RECEIVED OVER $9 MILLION DOLLARS
 OF FEDERAL GRANTS. THE DIRECTOR OF PARTNERSHIPS AND GOVERNMENT GRANTS AND GENERAL LEDGER
 ACCOUNTANT WILL WORK CLOSELY TO SUBMIT QUARTERLY REIMBURSEMENT REQUESTS FOR AMERICORPS FUNDING AND
 WILL SUPPORT THE PROGRAM SUPERVISOR WITH REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE.
 
 KIPP NEW JERSEY HAS STRONG RELATIONSHIPS WITH ORGANIZATIONS IN NEWARK AND NEARBY COMMUNITIES,
 INCLUDING TEACH FOR AMERICA, CITY YEAR, GREAT OAKS CHARTER SCHOOL AND CITIZEN SCHOOLS. THESE
 ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN SUPPORTIVE AND INSTRUCTIVE IN HELPING US THINK THROUGH HOW KIPP NEW JERSEY
 CAN CREATE A STRONG PROGRAM FOR AMERICORPS MEMBERS.
 
 C2: COMPLIANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY 
 
 KIPP NEW JERSEY WILL PUT SIGNIFICANT EFFORT INTO MAINTAINING SYSTEMS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO SEE A
 SNAPSHOT OF RESIDENTS' COMPLIANCE STANDING AND STUDENT PROGRESS AT ANY GIVEN TIME. WE WILL CREATE A
 GOOGLE-BASED TRACKING DOCUMENT THAT RESIDENTS WILL BE REQUIRED TO UPDATE ON A WEEKLY BASIS IN ORDER TO
 TRACK NUMBER OF SERVICE AND TRAINING HOURS. RESIDENTS WILL HAVE CLEAR STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT GOALS, AND
 BECAUSE WE TRACK STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT SYSTEMATICALLY AT KIPP NEW JERSEY, WE CAN CREATE A DASHBOARD
 THAT COMPILES ALL OF THE RELEVANT INFORMATION INTO ONE PLACE (SEE SAMPLE AMERICORPS RESIDENT
 DASHBOARD BELOW). THIS DASHBOARD WILL BE USED BY THE PROGRAM SUPERVISOR AND RESIDENT ADVISORS
 DURING WEEKLY AND MONTHLY MEETINGS, AND AT QUARTERLY PROGRESS CHECK-INS, SO THAT RESIDENTS ARE AWARE
 OF THEIR STANDING AT ALL TIMES.

 THE PROGRAM SUPERVISOR IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE TO CHECK FOR COMPLIANCE ISSUES OUTLINED BY
 AMERICORPS GUIDELINES AND PROVIDE REGULAR ACCOUNTABILITY FOR RESIDENTS AND RESIDENT ADVISORS. THE
 PROGRAM SUPERVISOR WILL REVIEW RESIDENT DASHBOARDS WEEKLY AND WILL MEET FOR AN HOUR MONTHLY IN
 ONE-ON-ONE MEETINGS WITH RESIDENT ADVISORS AND RESIDENTS. WHEN COMPLIANCE ISSUES ARISE, THE
 PROGRAM SUPERVISOR WILL SCHEDULE AN IMMEDIATE IN-PERSON MEETING WITH THE OFFENDER, AND PROVIDE AN

 D1 AND 2: COST EFFECTIVENESS AND BUDGET ADEQUACY 
 
 KIPP NEW JERSEY IS WILLING TO CONTRIBUTE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RESOURCES TOWARD THIS PROJECT. THERE
 ARE SEVERAL REASONS WHY WE BELIEVE THAT INVESTING MONEY INTO THIS PROGRAM WILL ULTIMATELY BENEFIT OUR
 STUDENTS, OUR NETWORK, AND THE RESIDENTS. ONE HUGE COST OF THIS PROGRAM IS PROVIDING HOUSING FOR OUR
 RESIDENTS. BASED ON OUR RESEARCH OF OTHER COMPARABLE TUTORING AND SERVICE PROGRAMS, WE BELIEVE THAT
 HOUSING IS WORTH THE INVESTMENT BECAUSE WE WILL YIELD HIGHER CALIBER RECRUITERS. BASED ON OUR RESEARCH,
 HIGH QUALITY, MISSION-ALIGNED TUTORS IS ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS THAT DETERMINE THE QUALITY OF THE SUPPORT
 FOR OUR STUDENTS. MOREOVER, WE ARE PUTTING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RESOURCES INTO THE TRAINING THAT
 OUR RESIDENTS WILL RECEIVE FROM RELAY. THIS INVESTMENT IS WORTHWHILE BECAUSE IT WILL YIELD HIGHER
 QUALITY INTERVENTION SERVICES AND ULTIMATELY SERVE MORE STUDENTS. FINALLY, IT IS OUR GOAL THAT THE
 MAJORITY OF THESE RESIDENTS WILL CHOOSE TO STAY IN EDUCATION AFTER THEIR SERVICE YEAR, PREFERABLY AT KIPP
 NEW JERSEY. WE BELIEVE THAT BE INVESTING IN THEM NOW, WE WILL CREATE A PIPELINE OF MISSION-DRIVEN,

 RATIONALE AND APPROACH/PROGRAM DESIGN
 A: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
 KIPP NEW JERSEY (FORMERLY TEAM CHARTER SCHOOLS) PROPOSES TO HAVE 11 AMERICORPS MEMBERS WHO
 WILL PROVIDE SMALL-GROUP INSTRUCTION, CLASSROOM ASSISTANCE AND SCHOOL-WIDE SPECIAL PROJECT SUPPORT IN
 NEWARK AND CAMDEN, NEW JERSEY. AT THE END OF THE FIRST PROGRAM YEAR, THE AMERICORPS MEMBERS
 WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR STUDENTS MEETING THEIR INDIVIDUALIZED MAP® AND READING GROWTH GOALS. 
 
 THIS PROGRAM WILL FOCUS ON THE CNCS FOCUS AREA(S) OF EDUCATION. THE CNCS INVESTMENT OF $151,030
 WILL BE MATCHED WITH A $50,000 PRIVATE DONATION AND $248,384 MATCHED BY KIPP NEW JERSEY.
 B1: PROBLEM/NEED
 
 IN THE UNITED STATES, 8% OF LOW-INCOME STUDENTS NATIONALLY GRADUATE FROM 4-YEAR COLLEGES (WITHIN SIX
 YEARS). THIS CATASTROPHICALLY LOW RATE CONTRASTS WITH A NATIONAL AVERAGE GRADUATION RATE OF 29% AND
 AN AVERAGE RATE OF 71% FOR HIGH-INCOME STUDENTS. WITHOUT A COLLEGE DEGREE, EARNING POTENTIAL AND
 OPPORTUNITIES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIMINISHED. ACCORDING TO THE LUMINA FOUNDATION, INCREASING THE
 NUMBER OF COLLEGE GRADUATES BOLSTERS THE ECONOMY AND STRENGTHENS OUR DEMOCRACY AND COMMUNITIES.
 EDUCATION ATTAINMENT LEADS TO IMPROVED HEALTH, LOWER CRIME RATES, AND INCREASED GLOBALLY AWARE
 CITIZENS MORE LIKELY TO PARTICIPATE IN CIVIC AND DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES, SUCH AS VOTING AND VOLUNTEERING
 (1). 
 
 KIPP NEW JERSEY SERVES TWO HIGH POVERTY CITIES IN NEW JERSEY. ACCORDING TO ADVOCATES FOR CHILDREN
 OF NEW JERSEY, IN THE CITY OF NEWARK, ONLY 25% OF RESIDENTS HAD SOME COLLEGE OR ASSOCIATES IN ART
 DEGREE OR HIGHER IN 2013 (2). 87% OF KIPP NEW JERSEY STUDENTS IN NEWARK QUALIFY FOR FREE OR REDUCED
 LUNCH, AND 100% OF KIPP NEW JERSEY STUDENTS IN CAMDEN QUALIFY FOR FREE LUNCH. KIPP NEW JERSEY IS
 PROVIDING A WORLD-CLASS EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS IN NEWARK AND CAMDEN AND STUDENTS ARE MAKING
 SIGNIFICANT ACADEMIC GAINS, BUT THESE GAINS ALONE ARE NOT ENOUGH GIVEN THE IMMENSITY OF THE
 ACHIEVEMENT GAP. 
 
 WHILE IT IS KIPP NEW JERSEY'S MISSION TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF POVERTY IN OUR CITIES BY DOUBLING THE COLLEGE
 GRADUATION RATE IN NEWARK AND TRIPLING THE COLLEGE GRADUATION RATE IN CAMDEN, OUR STUDENTS ARE NOT
 PAGE 3
 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
 NARRATIVES
 PROGRESSING ACADEMICALLY QUICKLY ENOUGH TO GET THEM COLLEGE READY. ACCORDING TO THE ACT® COLLEGE
 READINESS BENCHMARKS, THE MINIMUM ACT® COLLEGE READINESS ASSESSMENT SCORE REQUIRED FOR STUDENTS
 TO HAVE A HIGH PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS IN CREDIT-BEARING COLLEGE COURSES IS A COMPOSITE SCORE OF 21 (3). IN
 THE 2013-14 SCHOOL YEAR, KIPP NEW JERSEY STUDENTS PERFORMED ON AVERAGE THE HIGHEST WE HAVE EVER
 SEEN IN OUR NETWORK. HOWEVER, THE CLASS AVERAGE ACT® COMPOSITE SCORE WAS ONLY A 19. IN THE 2014-
 15 SCHOOL YEAR, OUR AVERAGE WAS A COMPOSITE SCORE OF 16. THESE SCORES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW WHERE
 OUR STUDENTS SHOULD BE IN ORDER TO TAKE NON-REMEDIAL CLASSES AND BE SET UP FOR LONG-TERM COLLEGE
 SUCCESS. THERE ARE ECONOMIC AND PERSISTENCE RAMIFICATIONS TO ENTERING COLLEGE WITHOUT THE CORE
 ACADEMICS NECESSARY TO AVOID REMEDIATION. BECAUSE REMEDIATION COURSES TYPICALLY EARN NO CREDITS,
 STUDENTS WHO TAKE THEM ARE PUT IN THE POSITION TO STAY IN SCHOOL LONGER (AND THUS PAY MORE) IN ORDER
 TO EARN A COLLEGE DEGREE. THIS IS A HUGE DISINCENTIVE FOR LOW-INCOME STUDENTS TO PERSIST. ACCORDING TO
 THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR EDUCATION STATISTICS (2007), ONLY 29% OF STUDENTS ENROLLED IN ONE OR TWO
 REMEDIAL ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS (ELA) AND/OR MATH COURSES END UP COMPLETING BACHELOR'S DEGREES
 WITHIN EIGHT YEARS. STUDENTS ENROLLED IN FOUR OR MORE REMEDIAL ELA AND/OR MATH COURSES HAVE A 19%
 CHANCE OF GRADUATING (4). 
 
 WHILE THE ACT® IS ONLY TAKEN IN HIGH SCHOOL, WE ARE ABLE TO SEE EVIDENCE OF THIS PROBLEM ACROSS OUR K-
 12 NETWORK BY ANALYZING OUR STUDENTS' MEASURES OF ACADEMIC PROGRESS® (MAP®) TEST SCORES. THE
 MAP® IS A NATIONALLY NORMED COMPUTER ADAPTIVE TEST THAT MEASURES INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS' PROGRESS AND
 GROWTH FROM KINDERGARTEN TO ELEVENTH GRADE. THE NORTHWEST EVALUATION ASSOCIATION (NWEA)
 CONDUCTED A LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF STUDENTS WHO HAD TAKEN THE MAP® FROM THIRD TO ELEVENTH GRADE,
 AND THEN SAT FOR THE ACT® ASSESSMENT (5). THIS STUDY CONNECTS MAP® DATA TO THE RAUSCH INTERVAL
 UNIT (RIT) SCALE WHICH CAN BE CORRELATED TO ACT LEVELS. THROUGH THIS STUDY, WE DEDUCED THAT IT IS
 POSSIBLE TO PROJECT COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS WITH OUR STUDENTS' MAP® DATA. THIS DATA SHOWS US
 THAT MANY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE NOT ON-TRACK TO BE COLLEGE READY BY THE TIME THEY ARE IN ELEVENTH GRADE.
 BASED ON 2013-14 ELA MAP® SCORES, 34% OF STUDENTS COMPLETING 4TH GRADE WITH KIPP NEW JERSEY
 ARE OFF-TRACK, 45% OF STUDENTS COMPLETING 8TH GRADE ARE OFF-TRACK, AND BY THE TIME THEY REACH 10TH
 GRADE, THE LAST YEAR BEFORE THEY TAKE THEIR ACT®, ALMOST 50% ARE NOT ON-TRACK TO BE COLLEGE-READY AS
 DEFINED BY SCORING A 21 ON THE ACT®. THESE NUMBERS ARE COMPARABLE WHEN LOOKING AT MATH MAP®
 SCORES. 
 
 IN ORDER FOR KIPP NEW JERSEY TO BETTER PREPARE OUR STUDENTS FOR LONG-TERM SUCCESS, WE MUST PROVIDE

 NARRATIVES
 ADDITIONAL, INDIVIDUALIZED SUPPORT TO STUDENTS PERFORMING BELOW THE BENCHMARK. AMERICORPS
 VOLUNTEERS WILL HELP BRIDGE THIS GAP BY CONDUCTING SMALL-GROUP REMEDIATION, REDUCING STUDENT-TEACHER
 RATIO IN THE KEY CONTENT AREAS OF ELA AND MATH, AND PROVIDING ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR SCHOOL-WIDE
 INITIATIVES AND PROJECTS. AMERICORPS RESIDENTS WILL WORK WITH APPROXIMATELY 165 KIPP NEW JERSEY
 STUDENTS. KIPP NEW JERSEY WILL CREATE A STUDENT CANDIDATE POOL CONSISTING OF STUDENTS WHO ARE AT-RISK
 ACADEMICALLY (PERFORMING IN THE BOTTOM TWO QUARTILES OF MAP® ACHIEVEMENT AND READING BELOW
 GRADE LEVEL AS ASCERTAINED BY FOUNTAS & PINNELL AND STEP DATA). 
 
 B2: THEORY OF CHANGE AND LOGIC MODEL
 
 KIPP NEW JERSEY SCHOOLS ARE FREE, OPEN-ENROLLMENT, COLLEGE-PREPARATORY PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS
 PREPARING STUDENTS IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES IN NEWARK AND CAMDEN, NEW JERSEY FOR SUCCESS IN
 COLLEGE AND IN LIFE. KIPP NEW JERSEY WAS FOUNDED IN 2002 WITH A SINGLE CLASS OF 80 FIFTH GRADERS AND
 HAS GROWN TO SERVE OVER 2,800 STUDENTS IN THE 2014-15 SCHOOL YEAR AT EIGHT SCHOOLS IN GRADES K-12. WE
 ALSO SERVE OVER 500 ALUMNI FOR WHOM WE PROVIDE COLLEGE COUNSELING AND SUPPORT SERVICES. THE VAST
 MAJORITY (91%) OF KIPP NEW JERSEY STUDENTS IN NEWARK ARE AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND IN CAMDEN ARE
 AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND LATINO (51% AND 47% RESPECTIVELY). 87% OF NEWARK STUDENTS QUALIFY FOR FREE OR
 REDUCED LUNCH AND 100% OF CAMDEN STUDENTS QUALIFY FOR FREE LUNCH. SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS MAKE
 UP OVER 13% OF OUR STUDENT BODY. THE NEIGHBORHOODS KIPP NEW JERSEY SERVES IN NEWARK AND
 CAMDEN ARE AMONG THE LOWEST PERFORMING IN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY. THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP IN THE
 COMMUNITIES WE SERVE HAS PERSISTED AT HIGH LEVELS FOR DECADES.
 
 KIPP NEW JERSEY'S MISSION IS TO DOUBLE THE GRADUATION RATE IN NEWARK AND TRIPLE IT IN CAMDEN. KIPP
 NEW JERSEY STUDENTS ENTER OUR NETWORK SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW GRADE LEVEL AND ARE NOT ALL MAKING THE
 GAINS NEEDED TO LEAVE OUR NETWORK COLLEGE-READY DUE TO THE IMMENSITY OF THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. THIS IS
 EVIDENCED BY KIPP NEW JERSEY'S AVERAGE ACT® SCORE AND NETWORK-WIDE MAP® DATA. OUR HIGHEST
 SCORING GRADUATING CLASS (2013-14) TO DATE SCORED AN AVERAGE ACT® COMPOSITE SCORE OF 19, WHICH IS
 BELOW THE MINIMUM ACT® COLLEGE READINESS ASSESSMENT COMPOSITE SCORE OF 21 RECOMMENDED FOR
 STUDENTS TO HAVE A HIGH PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS IN CREDIT-BEARING COLLEGE COURSES (6). KIPP NEW JERSEY'S
 2014-15 GRADUATING CLASS'S AVERAGE COMPOSITE ACT® SCORE WAS A 16. MOREOVER, WE SEE EVIDENCE OF
 THIS DEFICIT IN ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE GRADES BY ANALYZING OUR STUDENTS' MAP® SCORES. OF THE STUDENTS
 WHO COMPLETE 4TH GRADE WITH KIPP NEW JERSEY, 34% OF STUDENTS ARE NOT ON-TRACK TO BE COLLEGE-READY

 NARRATIVES
 IN ELA AND 24% ARE NOT ON-TRACK IN MATH. OF THE STUDENTS WHO COMPLETE 8TH GRADE WITH KIPP NEW
 JERSEY, 45% ARE NOT ON-TRACK TO BE COLLEGE-READY IN ELA, AND 40% ARE NOT ON TRACK IN MATH. 
 
 TO ENSURE ALL KIPP NEW JERSEY STUDENTS ARE ON-TRACK TO BEING COLLEGE READY, WE MUST PROVIDE MORE
 INDIVIDUALIZED REMEDIATION AND SMALL GROUP INSTRUCTION. THIS WILL ULTIMATELY OPEN NEW DOORS FOR THE
 STUDENTS OF NEWARK AND CAMDEN. THE KIPP NEW JERSEY AMERICORPS RESIDENT PROGRAM HAS BEEN
 CAREFULLY DESIGNED IN ORDER TO SUPPORT NEWARK AND CAMDEN STUDENTS WITH OUTLYING ACADEMIC NEEDS
 WHILE ALSO INVESTING AND TRAINING A COHORT OF EAGER, SERVICE-MINDED COLLEGE-GRADUATES IN PROVIDING
 WORLD-CLASS EDUCATION TO UNDER-SERVED COMMUNITIES. 
 
 KIPP NEW JERSEY WILL BRING ON 11 RESIDENTS OPERATING IN 8 SCHOOLS SERVING ROUGHLY 165 STUDENTS
 RANGING FROM 3RD TO 10TH GRADE WHO ARE BELOW THE BENCHMARK BASED ON MAP®, FOUNTAS & PINNELL,
 AND STEP DATA FROM SEPTEMBER 2015 THROUGH JUNE 2016 (1700+ HOURS PER RESIDENT). THESE RESIDENTS
 WILL BE SPLIT ACROSS KIPP NEW JERSEY'S EXISTING SCHOOLS AS FOLLOWS:
 
 * LIFE ACADEMY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - 2 RESIDENTS
 
 * SEEK ACADEMY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - 1 RESIDENT
 
 * THRIVE ACADEMY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - 2 RESIDENTS
 
 * SPARK ACADEMY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - 1 RESIDENT
 
 * REVOLUTION PRIMARY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - 1 RESIDENT
 
 * TEAM ACADEMY MIDDLE SCHOOL - 1 RESIDENT
 
 * RISE ACADEMY MIDDLE SCHOOL - 2 RESIDENTS
 
 * NEWARK COLLEGIATE ACADEMY HIGH SCHOOL - 1 RESIDENT
 
 EACH RESIDENT WILL PROVIDE INDIVIDUALIZED SMALL-GROUP INSTRUCTION AND SUPPORT TO ROUGHLY 15 STUDENTS
 WHO ARE NOT YET ON-TRACK TOWARDS COLLEGE READINESS. RESIDENT ACTIVITIES ARE DIVIDED INTO THREE
 COMPONENTS: 
 
 1) SMALL GROUP REMEDIATION. FOR ROUGHLY 2 HOURS A DAY, RESIDENTS WILL PULL STUDENTS PERFORMING BELOW
 GRADE LEVEL IN ORDER TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL REMEDIATION IN THE KEY AREAS OF ELA AND MATH. WORKING IN
 THIS CAPACITY BENEFITS BOTH RESIDENTS AND STUDENTS. RESIDENTS WILL BE TRAINED TO COLLECT, TRACK AND
 ANALYZE STUDENT DATA, AND TO USE CUTTING-EDGE REMEDIATION TACTICS TO ADDRESS THE DEFICITS. ONGOING
 TRAINING ON THESE SKILLS WILL BE PROVIDED BY THE PROGRAM SUPERVISOR, RESIDENT ADVISORS AND ADDITIONAL
 KIPP NEW JERSEY TEACHING AND LEADING STAFF. STUDENTS WILL BENEFIT BY RECEIVING HIGHLY INDIVIDUALIZED,
 DYNAMIC INSTRUCTION THAT REACHES THEM AT THEIR ACADEMIC LEVEL. BASED ON THEIR STUDENTS' NEEDS,
 PAGE 6
 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
 NARRATIVES
 RESIDENTS MAY ENLIST ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING MEANS OF INTERVENTION:
 
 * LEVELED LITERACY INTERVENTION (FOUNTAS & PINNELL) IS A SCRIPTED, SMALL-GROUP LITERACY INTERVENTION
 DESIGNED TO HELP EDUCATORS PROVIDE POWERFUL, DAILY, SMALL-GROUP INSTRUCTION FOR THE LOWEST ACHIEVING
 STUDENTS AT THEIR GRADE LEVEL. THIS INTERVENTION USES A COMBINATION OF READING, WRITING AND
 PHONICS/WORD STUDY. 
 
 * GUIDED READING (FOUNTAS & PINNELL) IS SMALL GROUP READING INSTRUCTION DESIGNED TO PROVIDE
 DIFFERENTIATED TEACHING THAT SUPPORTS STUDENTS IN DEVELOPING READING PROFICIENCY.
 
 * ONE-ON-ONE TUTORIALS ALLOW RESIDENTS TO WORK WITH OUR MOST OUTLYING LEARNERS TO PRE-TEACH AND RETEACH
 CONCEPTS THAT ARE CAUSING STRUGGLE IN THE CLASSROOM.
 
 * FASTT MATH (SCHOLASTIC) IS A BLENDED LEARNING MATH PROGRAM DESIGNED TO BUILD FLUENCY AND
 AUTOMATICITY. RESIDENTS WILL FACILITATE THIS ACTIVITY FOR 10 MINUTES EVERY DAY AS NEEDED. 
 
 * ACCELERATED READER (RENAISSANCE LEARNING) IS A BLENDED-LEARNING PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS EDUCATORS TO
 MONITOR AND TRACK STUDENT'S INDEPENDENT READING PRACTICES. RESIDENTS WILL TRACK STUDENT DATA AND USE
 TO INFORM FURTHER INTERVENTION PLANNING. THIS DATA WILL BE TRACKED ON RESIDENTS' DASHBOARDS AND WILL BE
 USED TO MONITOR RESIDENTS' INTERVENTION EFFORTS. 
 
 * ST MATH (MIND RESEARCH INSTITUTE) IS GAME-BASED INSTRUCTIONAL SOFTWARE FOR K-12 THAT IS DESIGNED
 TO BOOST MATH COMPREHENSION AND PROFICIENCY THROUGH VISUAL LEARNING. RESIDENTS WILL TRACK STUDENT
 DATA AND USE TO INFORM FURTHER INTERVENTION PLANNING. THIS DATA WILL BE TRACKED ON RESIDENTS'
 DASHBOARDS AND WILL BE USED TO MONITOR RESIDENTS' INTERVENTION EFFORTS. 
 
 2.) CLASSROOM ASSISTANCE. FOR ROUGHLY 2 HOURS A DAY, RESIDENTS WILL WORK DIRECTLY WITHIN AN ELA
 AND/OR MATH CLASSROOM IN A TEACHING ASSISTANT CAPACITY. THIS EXPERIENCE PROVIDES BENEFITS FOR BOTH
 RESIDENTS AND STUDENTS. BECAUSE RESIDENTS WILL BE WORKING ALONGSIDE CLASSROOM TEACHERS, THE STUDENTTEACHER
 RATIO WILL BE REDUCED FROM ROUGHLY 30:1 TO 15:1 ON AVERAGE DURING ELA AND/OR MATH BLOCKS.
 THIS BENEFITS OUR STUDENTS BECAUSE IT WILL ALLOW STRUGGLING STUDENTS TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL/REMEDIATED
 INSTRUCTION AS NEEDED. THIS EXPOSURE TO BEST-TEACHING PRACTICES WILL PROVIDE A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR
 RESIDENTS SHOULD THEY CHOOSE TO TEACH OR WORK IN EDUCATION PAST THEIR SERVICE YEAR. 
 
 3.) SPECIAL PROJECT SUPPORT. FOR ROUGHLY 2 HOURS A DAY, RESIDENTS WILL SUPPORT INITIATIVES WITHIN THE
 SCHOOL (ACADEMIC AND NON-ACADEMIC). THESE INITIATIVES COULD INCLUDE (BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO) THE
 FOLLOWING: AFTER SCHOOL CLUBS AND SPORTS, ADDITIONAL TUTORING, OUR KIPP THROUGH COLLEGE INITIATIVES,
 SCHOOL MUSICALS, SCHOOL-WIDE SYSTEM INNOVATION AND UPKEEP, OPERATIONAL SUPPORT, DATA SUPPORT, ETC.
 RESIDENTS WILL BUILD UPON THEIR INDIVIDUAL STRENGTHS AND INTERESTS IN ORDER TO MOTIVATE STUDENTS TO EXCEL
 BOTH IN AND OUT OF THE CLASSROOM.

 B3: EVIDENCE BASE
 
 KIPP NEW JERSEY'S MISSION IS TO DOUBLE THE GRADUATION RATE OF NEWARK AND TRIPLE THE GRADUATION RATE
 OF CAMDEN, NEW JERSEY. THIS GOAL IS NOT AN ARBITRARY ONE. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT A FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE
 GRADUATES EARN $900,000 MORE OVER A LIFETIME THAN HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES WITHOUT ANY POSTSECONDARY
 EDUCATION (7). IN ORDER TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF POVERTY IN OUR NATIONS, MOST HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED
 COMMUNITIES, THE ABILITY TO NOT ONLY GET INTO, BUT COMPLETE COLLEGE MUST BE OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY. THE
 KIPP NEW JERSEY AMERICORPS RESIDENT PROGRAM WAS CREATED TO PROVIDE THE ADDITIONAL REMEDIATION
 NEEDED TO GET OUR UNDERPERFORMING STUDENTS PREPARED TO NOT ONLY ENTER, BUT COMPLETE COLLEGE. IN ORDER
 TO DESIGN THE PROGRAM THAT WILL BENEFIT OUR KIDS MOST, WE DID EXTENSIVE RESEARCH OF STUDIES AND
 COMPARABLE APPROACHES. FIRST, WE FOUND ABUNDANT EVIDENCE THAT TUTORING LEADS TO POSITIVE OUTCOMES
 FOR STUDENTS. FOR INSTANCE, DURING THE 2013-14 ACADEMIC YEAR, THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO'S URBAN
 EDUCATION LAB (UEL) MONITORED A GROUP OF STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN INDIVIDUALIZED TWO-ON-ONE
 MATH INSTRUCTION FOR AN HOUR A DAY, EVERY DAY DESIGNED TO HELP STUDENTS MEET GRADE LEVEL AND INCREASE
 THE LIKELIHOOD OF PASSING REQUIRED MATH COURSES FOR GRADUATION. AFTER JUST SIX MONTHS THEIR DATA
 SHOWED:
 
 * IMPROVED STUDENT MATH TEST SCORES BY THE EQUIVALENT OF ABOUT THREE YEARS OF LEARNING FOR THE TYPICAL
 AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT;
 
 * IMPROVED MATH GRADES EQUAL TO 0.6 POINTS ON A 4-POINT SCALE;
 
 * REDUCED COURSE FAILURES BY 57% (2 FEWER COURSES FAILED PER YEAR);
 
 * INCREASED SCHOOL ATTENDANCE (2.5 WEEKS MORE SCHOOL ATTENDED PER YEAR);
 
 * AND INCREASED BY NEARLY 50% THE LIKELIHOOD THAT YOUTH ARE ON-TRACK FOR GRADUATION ACCORDING TO THE
 CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOLS DEFINITION FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS (8)
 
 RESEARCH ALSO SHOWED US THAT SUCCESSFUL TUTORING PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE ONE DESCRIBED SHARE SEVERAL
 COMMON FEATURES. THESE INCLUDE PROVIDING ONGOING TRAINING TO TUTORS, TRACKING ONGOING FORMATIVE
 ASSESSMENTS AS A MEANS TO GUIDE THE REMEDIATION PROCESS, REQUIRING COLLABORATION WITH EXPERIENCED
 CLASSROOM TEACHERS, AND CAREFUL SCREENING AND SELECTION CRITERIA FOR TUTORS (9). IT WAS WITH THIS IN
 MIND THAT THE KIPP NEW JERSEY AMERICORPS RESIDENT PROGRAM WAS STRUCTURED WITH SUCH INTENSE
 PAGE 9

 NARRATIVES
 SUPPORTS AND ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES IN PLACE FOR RESIDENTS. 
 
 WHILE THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF TUTORING PROGRAMS THAT HAVE YIELDED GREAT GAINS FOR
 STUDENTS FROM LOW-INCOME BACKGROUNDS IN RECENT YEARS, BLUE ENGINE, AN AMERICORPS FUNDED TUTORING
 PROGRAM IN NEW YORK CITY, PROVIDES PERHAPS THE MOST COMPELLING EVIDENCE OF THE BENEFITS THAT
 PURPOSEFUL AND STRUCTURED TUTORING CAN PROVIDE OUR STUDENTS. BLUE ENGINE SERVES A POPULATION WITH
 DEMOGRAPHICS SIMILAR TO THOSE OF KIPP NEW JERSEY. 96% OF THE STUDENT BODY THAT BLUE ENGINE SERVES
 QUALIFIES FOR FREE OR REDUCED LUNCH AND 94% ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN OR LATINO (10). SIMILARLY, 87% OF
 KIPP NEW JERSEY STUDENTS QUALIFY FOR FREE OR REDUCED LUNCH AND 98% ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN OR LATINO
 (11). BLUE ENGINE ALSO PROVIDES SIMILAR INTERVENTIONS TO THE ONES WE ARE PROPOSING AT KIPP NEW
 JERSEY, WHEREIN RECENT COLLEGE GRADUATES SPEND A YEAR OF SERVICE PROVIDING SMALL GROUP AND ONE-ONONE
 TUTORING SUPPORT, AS WELL AS PROVIDING ADDITIONAL SCHOOL-WIDE SUPPORT OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM
 (12). CLASSROOMS SUPPORTED BY BLUE ENGINE TUTORS ACHIEVED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN COLLEGE READINESS
 BETWEEN 2010 AND 2014. ON THE JUNE 2011 NY STATE EXAM, 43% OF 9TH GRADERS DEMONSTRATED COLLEGEREADY
 MATH SKILLS (MEASURED BY SCORES OF 80+ ON THE EXAM). THIS NUMBER IS NEARLY TRIPLE THE NUMBER
 FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, WHEN BLUE ENGINE WAS NOT THERE TO SUPPORT. BY 2014, THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS
 SCORING COLLEGE READY SCORES ON THE COMMON CORE ALIGNED EXAM (ACROSS BOTH ELA AND MATH) INCREASED
 BY 73% (13). FOR LOW-INCOME STUDENTS WITH OUTLYING ACADEMIC NEEDS, INTENSE, PURPOSEFUL TUTORING CAN
 BE A GAME-CHANGER WHEN AIMING AT COLLEGE-READINESS. 
 
 ONE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BLUE ENGINE'S PROGRAM MODEL AND KIPP NEW JERSEY'S IS THE AGE OF THE
 POPULATION SERVED. BLUE ENGINE HAS CHOSEN TO FOCUS ON TUTORING AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL EXCLUSIVELY.
 KIPP NEW JERSEY PLANS TO REMEDIATE AT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND MIDDLE SCHOOL LEVEL, AS WELL AS THE
 HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL, FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS. STUDIES SHOW THAT A SIGNIFICANT INDICATOR OF COLLEGE
 READINESS IS THE ABILITY TO TAKE COLLEGE-PREPARATORY CLASSES IN HIGH SCHOOL. STUDIES CONDUCTED BY THE
 DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAVE FOUND THAT ""A RIGOROUS HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM HAS A GREATER IMPACT ON
 BACHELOR'S DEGREE COMPLETION THAN ANY OTHER PRE-COLLEGE INDICATOR OF ACADEMIC PREPARATION"" (14).
 CURRENTLY, ROUGHLY 45% PERCENT OF KIPP NEW JERSEY STUDENTS REQUIRE SOME FORM OF REMEDIATION
 COURSES IN HIGH SCHOOL. IN ORDER TO CORRECT THIS, WE ARE PLACING EMPHASIS ON GETTING OUR STUDENTS ON A
 COLLEGE-READY TRACK BEFORE THEY ENTER OUR HIGH SCHOOL.
 
 IT IS IMPORTANT TO KIPP NEW JERSEY THAT WE ACCURATELY ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF OUR PROGRAM. AS
 PAGE 10
 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
 NARRATIVES
 EXPLAINED FURTHER IN THIS GRANT, WE WILL BE PUTTING SYSTEMS IN PLACE FOR RESIDENTS, RESIDENT ADVISORS, THE
 PROGRAM SUPERVISOR AND AMERICORPS PERSONNEL TO ASSESS TUTOR AND STUDENT PROGRESS AT ANY TIME.
 FURTHERMORE, IN ORDER TO GAUGE THE OVERALL EFFICACY OF OUR WORK, WE WILL COMPARE THE GROWTH MADE BY
 STUDENTS WHO RECEIVE AMERICORPS TUTORING WITH STUDENTS WHO DO NOT RECEIVE AMERICORPS TUTORING.
 BOTH GROUPS WILL BE COMPRISED OF STUDENTS WHO MEET OUR ENTRY CRITERIA - BEING ACADEMICALLY AT RISK
 BASED ON MAP®, FOUNTAS AND PINNELL AND STEP ASSESSMENT DATA. AFTER 1 YEAR OF THE PROGRAM WE WILL
 LOOK AT THE GAINS FOR BOTH GROUPS BASED ON MAP® ASSESSMENTS. IN THIS WAY, WE WILL BE ABLE TO
 CONCLUDE THAT THE RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN THE DECIDING FORCE IN OUR STUDENTS' POSITIVE OUTCOMES.
 
 B4: NOTICE PRIORITY 
 
 KIPP NEW JERSEY IS REQUESTING AMERICORPS FUNDING SUPPORT TO IMPROVE THE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES FOR
 ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN AND SUPPORT ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS TO PREPARE FOR
 SUCCESS IN POST-SECONDARY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. IN NEWARK, 87% OF STUDENTS WE SERVE ARE ELIGIBLE
 FOR FREE OR REDUCED LUNCH AND 100% OF OUR STUDENTS IN CAMDEN ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE LUNCH. KIPP NEW
 JERSEY BELIEVES THAT ONE DAY, OUR NATION WILL KNOW NEWARK AND CAMDEN, NEW JERSEY, AS CITIES OF
 WORLD-CLASS PUBLIC EDUCATION. THE KIPP NEW JERSEY AMERICORPS RESIDENT PROGRAM AIMS TO IMPROVE
 THE LIVES OF OUR STUDENTS BY PROVIDING THE REMEDIATION THEY NEED TO BE COLLEGE READY BY THE END OF HIGH
 SCHOOL. THE PROGRAM ALSO AIMS TO STRENGTHEN OUR COMMUNITIES BY PROVIDING THIS SERVICE AND TRAINING
 OPPORTUNITY TO NEWARK AND CAMDEN RESIDENTS. THEY WILL RECEIVE TRAINING AND GRADUATE CREDIT FROM
 RELAY GRADUATE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, WHICH WILL PREPARE THEM TO PERSIST IN THE FIELD OF EDUCATION
 BEYOND THEIR SERVICE YEAR. THE PROGRAM GIVES CIVIC-MINDED INDIVIDUALS THE CHANCE TO HAVE A
 MEASURABLE IMPACT ON THE LIVES OF LOW-INCOME STUDENTS. 
 
 B5: MEMBER TRAINING 
 
 TRAINING THE INDIVIDUALS DIRECTLY SERVING OUR STUDENTS HAS ALWAYS BEEN A HUGE PRIORITY FOR KIPP NEW
 JERSEY, AND THUS EXTENSIVE RESOURCES HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED TO ENSURE THAT RESIDENTS ARE PREPARED TO GIVE
 STUDENTS THE ACADEMIC SUPPORT THEY NEED. THE THREE MAIN COMPONENTS OF HIGH QUALITY MEMBER
 TRAINING COME IN THE FORMS OF 1) PROGRAM SUPERVISOR 2) SITE-BASED RESIDENT ADVISORS AND 3) RELAY
 GRADUATE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION. TRAINING AND SUPERVISION FOR RESIDENTS WILL BE INTERRELATED. 
 
 PAGE 11
 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
 NARRATIVES
 THE PROGRAM SUPERVISOR IS A FULL-TIME KIPP NEW JERSEY EMPLOYEE WHO WILL SPEND 75% OF HER TIME
 OVERSEEING THIS PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM SUPERVISOR WILL PARTICIPATE IN AMERICORPS TRAININGS AND THEN
 PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SESSIONS WITH THE RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS (SCHOOL LEADERS, RESIDENT
 ADVISORS, RESIDENTS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT) IN ORDER TO TURNKEY THIS INFORMATION. THE PROGRAM
 SUPERVISOR WILL PROVIDE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR, MID-YEAR, AND END OF YEAR TRAINING FOR RESIDENTS AND
 RESIDENT ADVISORS ON AMERICORPS'S MISSION, REGULATIONS AND UPDATES. THE PROGRAM SUPERVISOR WILL
 PROVIDE A FULL LIST OF THE PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES THE CORPORATION PUBLISHED IN AUGUST 2002 AT THESE
 TRAINING SESSIONS SO MEMBERS ARE FULLY AWARE OF WHAT THE REGULATIONS STATE REGARDING ACTIVITIES
 MEMBERS ARE PROHIBITED FROM DOING. ADDITIONALLY, THE PROGRAM SUPERVISOR WILL MEET WITH RESIDENT
 ADVISORS AND RESIDENTS AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH FOR AN HOUR TO MONITOR STUDENT ACADEMIC PROGRESS,
 RESIDENTS' GROWTH, AND THE OVERALL FUNCTIONALITY OF THE PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM SUPERVISOR ALSO
 COMPLETES FORMAL EVALUATIONS (OR GATEWAYS) ALONG WITH RELAY GRADUATE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION
 PROFESSIONALS, COORDINATES ALL PROGRAMMATIC EVENTS (INCLUDING AMERICORPS DAYS OF SERVICE AND EVENTS
 WITH PARTNERING ORGANIZATIONS), AND ACTS AS A LIAISON BETWEEN RELAY GRADUATE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION AND
 OUR RESIDENTS AND RESIDENT ADVISORS. THE PROGRAM SUPERVISOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COMPILATION OF ALL
 COMPLIANCE PAPERWORK AND REPORTING REQUIRED BY AMERICORPS. FINALLY, THE PROGRAM SUPERVISOR
 CREATES AND EXECUTES RESIDENT IMPROVEMENT PLANS AND TERMINATIONS (IF NEEDED).
 
 RESIDENTS WILL BE SUPPORTED DAILY BY A RESIDENT ADVISOR AT EACH SCHOOL SITE. RESIDENT ADVISORS WILL
 HAVE MORE THAN ONE YEAR OF TEACHING WITH KIPP NEW JERSEY, DEMONSTRATE A CLEAR RECORD OF SUCCESS
 WORKING WITH STUDENTS, SHOW STRONG CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT SKILLS, BE ASPIRING INSTRUCTIONAL LEADERS,
 HAVE THE CAPACITY TO MANAGE ONE RESIDENT, AND BE AN ELA OR MATH TEACHER. WHILE NOT REQUIRED, THE
 PROGRAM SUPERVISOR WILL BE LOOKING FOR RESIDENT ADVISOR CANDIDATES WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE WORKING
 WITH AMERICORPS MEMBERS AND RELAY STUDENTS. THE RESIDENT ADVISOR WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING
 WEEKLY LESSON PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT FEEDBACK TO THE RESIDENT, AS WELL AS GUIDING THE RESIDENT
 THROUGH THE SYSTEMS AND CULTURE OF HIS OR HER SCHOOL. RESIDENT ADVISORS WILL HAVE RECEIVED
 AMERICORPS TRAINING FROM THE PROGRAM SUPERVISOR, AND THUS WILL BE PREPARED TO SUPPORT RESIDENTS IN
 ADHERING TO AMERICORPS EXPECTATIONS. RESIDENT ADVISORS WILL BE EQUIPPED WITH A WRITTEN OVERVIEW OF
 AMERICORPS EXPECTATIONS, AND WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM SUPERVISOR SHOULD ANY QUESTIONS ARISE.
 RESIDENTS WILL PARTICIPATE IN WEEKLY CHECK-INS WITH THE RESIDENT ADVISOR, MONTHLY CHECK-INS WITH
 PROGRAM SUPERVISORS, SCHOOL-WIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, AND NETWORK PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
 THREE TIMES PER YEAR.

 ANOTHER KEY COMPONENT OF RESIDENT TRAINING COMES IN THE FORM OF RELAY GRADUATE SCHOOL OF
 EDUCATION, WHERE ALL RESIDENTS WILL BE ENROLLED. THROUGH THEIR WORK WITH RELAY, RESIDENTS WILL RECEIVE
 EXTENSIVE WEEKLY TRAINING AND DELIBERATE PRACTICE IN PROVEN, HIGHLY EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNIQUES.
 DURING THE PROGRAM, RESIDENTS WILL LEARN WHAT IT TAKES TO HAVE HIGH-EXPECTATIONS, AND BE A DATADRIVEN,
 STRATEGIC EDUCATOR. RELAY WILL PROVIDE 3 SCHOOL DAY HOURS PER WEEK, 2 WEEKNIGHTS AND 1
 SATURDAY PER MONTH OF IN-PERSON TRAINING. ADDITIONALLY, RELAY GRADUATE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION
 PROFESSORS WILL OBSERVE RESIDENTS TEACHING IN ONE-ON-ONE AND SMALL GROUPS AND PROVIDE CONSTRUCTIVE
 FEEDBACK ONCE A MONTH. RESIDENTS WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE SOME ONLINE TRAINING MODULES FOR
 THEIR RELAY GRADUATE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION WORKLOAD. IN COOPERATION WITH RELAY, RESIDENTS WILL HAVE
 SEVERAL SET EVALUATIONS OR 'GATEWAYS' ASSESSING THEIR GROWTH AS TUTORS AND CONTRIBUTORS TO OUR STUDENTS'
 ACHIEVEMENT. THE GATEWAYS AND ASSOCIATED SKILLS ARE AS FOLLOWS:
 
 * GATEWAY #1 (SEPTEMBER) - MINDSETS AND PROFESSIONALISM: RESIDENTS WILL DEMONSTRATE KEY MINDSETS
 OF HIGH EXPECTATIONS, PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY, CONTINUING IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS, AS WELL AS
 PROFESSIONALISM STANDARDS. 
 
 * GATEWAY #2 (OCTOBER) - MANAGEMENT SIMULATION: RESIDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO MANAGE SMALL GROUP
 BEHAVIOR BY APPLYING TECHNIQUES TO ENSURE POSITIVE MOMENTUM AND LEARNING. 
 
 * GATEWAY #3 (DECEMBER) - OPENING A LESSON: RESIDENTS MUST PROVE THAT THEY CAN TEACH THE OPENING
 OF A LESSON AND THE INTRODUCTION TO NEW MATERIAL. 
 
 * GATEWAY #4 (MARCH) - TEACHING A FULL LESSON: RESIDENTS WILL SUBMIT A FULL LESSON VIDEO AND BE
 OBSERVED TEACHING A LESSON IN THEIR SCHOOLS TO DETERMINE THEIR READINESS FOR THE INCREASED ON RAMP INTO
 TEACHING IN MAY AND ABILITY TO RUN A CLASSROOM THE FOLLOWING YEAR. 
 
 IF, AT THE COMPLETION OF THEIR SERVICE YEAR, RESIDENTS ARE INTERESTED IN PURSUING A TEACHING POSITION WITH
 KIPP NEW JERSEY OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL, THEY MAY OPT INTO A FINAL GATEWAY.
 
 * GATEWAY #5 (MAY) FULL TIME TEACHING PLACEMENT: IN CONJUNCTION WITH PARTNER SCHOOLS, RESIDENTS
 WILL BE ASSESSED FOR THEIR READINESS OF BECOMING FULL-TIME TEACHERS. 
 
 GATEWAY #5 IS NOT A REQUIREMENT OF THE PROGRAM.
 
 B6: MEMBER SUPERVISION

 NARRATIVES
 IN NEWARK FOR THREE YEARS AT A COMPREHENSIVE HIGH SCHOOL. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS AT HER HIGH SCHOOL,
 MEAGHAN LOBBIED FOR AND IMPLEMENTED AN INTERVENTION PROGRAM FOR ESL AND STRUGGLING READERS IN HER
 SCHOOL, WHICH RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT GAINS FOR HER UNDER PERFORMING STUDENTS. IN 2009 SHE JOINED
 TEAM ACADEMY, A KIPP NEW JERSEY MIDDLE SCHOOL, AS AN 8TH GRADE READING TEACHER. HER 8TH GRADE
 STUDENTS SCORED 92% PROFICIENT OR ADVANCED PROFICIENT ON THE NJASK IN 2010. IN 2011, MEAGHAN
 MOVED TO THE RECRUITMENT TEAM OF THE CENTRAL OFFICE WHERE SHE OVERSAW SECONDARY RECRUITMENT AND
 NETWORK PARTNERSHIPS. SHE HAS LED PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SESSIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ON
 INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICES FOR NEW TEACHERS AND WORKED FOR TEACH FOR AMERICA'S SUMMER INSTITUTE. FOR
 THE 2015-16 SCHOOL YEAR, HER ROLE WILL FOCUS ON PIPELINE DEVELOPMENT, WHERE SHE WILL GENERATE NEW
 TALENT PIPELINES THROUGH STUDENT-TEACHER PARTNERSHIPS, INTERNSHIPS, AND BROADENING KIPP NEW JERSEY'S
 UNIVERSITY PARTNERSHIPS. 
 
 AS THE FOUNDING PROJECT SUPERVISOR FOR KIPP NEW JERSEY'S AMERICORPS PROGRAM, MEAGHAN WILL
 PARTICIPATE IN AMERICORPS MANAGER TRAINING IN AUGUST 2015 AND MONTHLY CONFERENCE CALLS OR MEETINGS
 FOR CONTINUED TRAINING. THROUGH THE MANAGER TRAINING, MONTHLY MEETINGS, AND COLLABORATION WITH
 OTHER PROGRAM MANAGERS, MEAGHAN WILL FULLY UNDERSTAND THE AMERICORPS EXPECTATIONS TO IMPLEMENT
 OUR PROGRAM AND BE PREPARED TO TRAIN OUR RESIDENT ADVISORS AND RESIDENTS. 
 
 B7: MEMBER EXPERIENCE
 
 BECAUSE AMERICORPS RESIDENTS WILL BE GOING THROUGH RELAY GRADUATE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, AND
 BECAUSE THERE ARE SEVERAL LAYERS OF TRAINING AND SUPPORT BUILT INTO THE PROGRAM, THEY WILL BE ABLE TO
 WALK AWAY FROM THEIR YEAR OF SERVICE WITH REAL-WORLD TEACHING AND SKILLS THAT WILL MAKE THEM HIGHLY
 MARKETABLE IN THE EDUCATION JOB MARKET. RESIDENTS WILL COMPLETE THEIR SERVICE YEAR WITH EXPERIENCE
 WORKING IN AN URBAN SCHOOL SETTING, LEADING SMALL GROUP INSTRUCTION, HAVING OPPORTUNITIES TO TAKE ON
 LEADERSHIP ROLES IN SPECIAL PROJECTS FOR THEIR SCHOOL, AND VOLUNTEERING WITH SEVERAL SERVICE PROJECTS IN
 THEIR COMMUNITIES. RESIDENTS WILL HAVE THE OPTION TO APPLY FOR A FULL-TIME TEACHING POSITION (WITH
 KIPP NEW JERSEY OR ELSEWHERE, ASSUMING THE ORGANIZATION IS WILLING TO HIRE ALTERNATE ROUTE TEACHING
 CANDIDATES) THE YEAR AFTER THEIR SERVICE YEAR AND/OR CONTINUE WORKING WITH RELAY TO OBTAIN THEIR
 MASTERS IN EDUCATION. RESIDENTS WILL BE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO CONTINUE WORKING WITHIN THE NEWARK
 AND/OR CAMDEN COMMUNITIES IN SOME CAPACITY AFTER THEIR SERVICE YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, ALL RESIDENTS WILL
 BE ENCOURAGED TO STAY CONNECTED TO KIPP NEW JERSEY THROUGH SEVERAL ANNUAL ALUMNI NEWSLETTERS AND

 ONE-OFF VOLUNTEERING OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN OUR NETWORK.
 
 AMERICORPS RESIDENTS WILL HAVE MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK WITH ONE ANOTHER AND FORM A COHORT.
 THOSE RESIDENTS WHO CHOOSE TO OPT INTO LIVING WITH THEIR FELLOW RESIDENTS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO
 LIVE AND WORK ALONGSIDE OTHER SERVICE MEMBERS IN THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY SERVE. BEYOND THAT,
 RESIDENTS WILL COME TOGETHER FOR MONTHLY MEETINGS IN ORDER TO DEVELOP AN INCLUSIVE SENSE OF
 COMMUNITY AND SUPPORT. AT MONTHLY MEETINGS, RESIDENTS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE PART IN
 DIVERSITY TRAINING, MINDSET COACHING, AND SELF-REFLECTION TO ENSURE THAT THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE
 RESIDENTS ACQUIRE SKILLS AND PERSPECTIVE.
 
 KIPP NEW JERSEY BELIEVES THAT FINDING SMART, DRIVEN, KID-FOCUSED STAFF IS CRUCIAL TO PROVIDING OUR
 STUDENTS WITH THE EDUCATION THEY DESERVE. THIS PHILOSOPHY WILL STAND TRUE WHEN WE RECRUIT RESIDENTS.
 WE WILL LOOK TO HIRE LARGELY FROM WITHIN THE NEWARK AND CAMDEN COMMUNITIES. WE WILL START BY
 REACHING OUT TO KIPP NEW JERSEY'S ALUMNI TO GAUGE INTEREST AND TO GARNER REFERRALS. WE WILL ALSO
 REACH OUT TO LONG-STANDING COMMUNITY PARTNERS (WIGHT FOUNDATION, NJ SEEDS, NJ LEEP, KIDS CORP)
 TO GAUGE INTEREST AND REAP REFERRALS. WE WILL ALSO CAPITALIZE ON OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL UNIVERSITIES
 (RUTGERS NEWARK, RUTGERS CAMDEN, RUTGERS NEW BRUNSWICK, KEAN UNIVERSITY, BLOOMFIELD UNIVERSITY,
 SETON HALL UNIVERSITY) IN ORDER TO RECRUIT HIGH CALIBER CANDIDATES. 
 
 B8: COMMITMENT TO AMERICORPS IDENTIFICATION
 
 KIPP NEW JERSEY STAFF AND STUDENTS WOULD BE PROUD TO PARTNER WITH AMERICORPS. MANY OF OUR STAFF
 MEMBERS ARE AMERICORP ALUMNI (CITY YEAR, TEACH FOR AMERICA, CITIZEN SCHOOLS), AND THUS ARE
 FAMILIAR WITH THE SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND PERSPECTIVE THAT TIME SPENT IN SERVICE CAN CREATE. THERE ARE
 SEVERAL WAYS THAT WE WILL ENSURE THAT OUR RESIDENTS VALUE THEIR IDENTITY AS AMERICORPS VOLUNTEERS.
 FIRST, RESIDENTS WILL LEARN ABOUT THE HISTORY AND PURPOSE OF AMERICORPS DURING THEIR INITIAL ORIENTATION
 SESSIONS. RESIDENTS WILL REPEAT THE PLEDGE, AND THAT PLEDGE WILL BE PROMINENTLY DISPLAYED DURING
 RESIDENT COHORT MEETINGS SO IT CAN BE REFERENCED AND REINFORCED. RESIDENTS WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO
 PROMINENTLY DISPLAY THE AMERICORPS LOGO DAILY. KIPP NEW JERSEY WILL BE PROVIDING OUTERWEAR AND
 BADGES TO ALL RESIDENTS, WHICH SHOULD BE WORN EVERY DAY TO REPRESENT THEIR AMERICORPS STANDING.
 MOREOVER, KIPP NEW JERSEY WILL MAKE SURE THAT AMERICORPS SIGNAGE IS PROMINENTLY PLACED IN THE
 CLASSROOMS WHERE RESIDENTS ARE TUTORING, AS WELL AS IN SHARED SPACE AT THE SCHOOL. THE AMERICORPS SEAL
 PAGE 15
 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
 NARRATIVES
 WILL BE REPRESENTED ON KIPP NEW JERSEY'S WEBSITE AND ALL MATERIALS BRANDED FOR THE PROGRAM
 (PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT MATERIALS, PROMOTIONAL PRODUCTS, ETC.).
 
 WE ARE FORTUNATE THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL AMERICORPS PARTNERS WORKING ALONGSIDE US IN OUR
 COMMUNITIES. IN NEWARK, TEACH FOR AMERICA, CITIZEN SCHOOLS, AND GREAT OAKS CHARTER SCHOOL ARE ALL
 DOING EXCELLENT WORK IN OUR CITY, AND WE WOULD LIKE TO PARTNER WITH THEM TO CREATE A COMMUNITY OF
 SERVICE-DRIVEN INDIVIDUALS INTERESTED IN MAKING A UNIFIED, POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE WORLD AROUND THEM.
 WE WILL HOLD SOCIAL FUNCTIONS EVERY OTHER MONTH, AS WELL AS AN END OF YEAR CELEBRATION TO RECOGNIZE
 ACCOMPLISHMENTS. KIPP NEW JERSEY AMERICORPS RESIDENTS WILL BE REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE
 FOLLOWING SERVICE PROJECTS:
 
 * MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. HOLIDAY 
 
 * AMERICORPS WEEK

 C1: ORGANIZATIONAL BACKGROUND AND STAFFING
 
 SINCE FOUNDING ITS FIRST MIDDLE SCHOOL IN 2002, KIPP NEW JERSEY HAS OPENED AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN
 SCHOOLS AND EXPANDED TO CAMDEN. WE DO NOT EXPAND OR OPEN MORE SCHOOLS WITHOUT IDENTIFYING THE
 LEADERSHIP AND TEACHING STAFF OF THE CALIBER WE NEED TO SERVE STUDENTS. TO SUPPORT IDENTIFYING TALENT
 AND CONTINUING TO GROW OUR SCHOOLS, KIPP NEW JERSEY HAS BUILT A STRONG CENTRAL OFFICE SUPPORT. OUR
 SCHOOL LEADERS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT ALL HAVE BETWEEN 5-12 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN TEACHING,
 EDUCATION, OR EDUCATION MANAGEMENT WITHIN OUR SCHOOLS. FOR THE 2014-15 SCHOOL YEAR, THREE OF OUR
 PRINCIPALS MOVED INTO NETWORK FACING ROLES TO SUPPORT OUR CONTINUED EXPANSION TO SERVE MORE STUDENTS.
 ENSURING WE SUCCESSFULLY SCALE IS A KEY PRIORITY FOR OUR NETWORK. IT'S CRUCIAL THAT WE CONSIDER HOW WE
 CAN EXPAND OUR TEACHER BASE AS FAST AS WE GROW OUR SCHOOLS. PART OF OUR RECRUITMENT TEAM'S GOALS FOR
 THE 2015-16 SCHOOL YEAR IS TO DEVELOP A TEACHER PIPELINE AND TRAINING PROGRAM. WORKING WITH
 AMERICORPS MEMBERS, WE CAN TAKE NOVICE EDUCATORS AND PROVIDE THE RESOURCES AND TRAINING THEY NEED
 TO PREPARE THEM TO MAKE AN IMPACT IN OUR COMMUNITIES AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THEIR SERVICE YEAR IF
 THEY ARE INTERESTED. OUR PROGRAM SUPERVISOR WILL SPEND 75% OF HER TIME MANAGING AND TRAINING OUR
 AMERICORPS MEMBERS SO THEY ARE PREPARED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS.

 KIPP NEW JERSEY IS CURRENTLY THE SUB RECIPIENT OF FOUR FEDERAL GRANTS THROUGH THE KIPP NATIONAL OFFICE
 AND A NEW JERSEY STATE RACE TO THE TOP GRANT. THESE GRANTS ARE ALL ADMINISTERED ON A COST
 REIMBURSEMENT BASIS. SINCE FOUNDING IN 2002, KIPP NEW JERSEY HAS RECEIVED OVER $9 MILLION DOLLARS
 OF FEDERAL GRANTS. THE DIRECTOR OF PARTNERSHIPS AND GOVERNMENT GRANTS AND GENERAL LEDGER
 ACCOUNTANT WILL WORK CLOSELY TO SUBMIT QUARTERLY REIMBURSEMENT REQUESTS FOR AMERICORPS FUNDING AND
 WILL SUPPORT THE PROGRAM SUPERVISOR WITH REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE.
 
 KIPP NEW JERSEY HAS STRONG RELATIONSHIPS WITH ORGANIZATIONS IN NEWARK AND NEARBY COMMUNITIES,
 INCLUDING TEACH FOR AMERICA, CITY YEAR, GREAT OAKS CHARTER SCHOOL AND CITIZEN SCHOOLS. THESE
 ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN SUPPORTIVE AND INSTRUCTIVE IN HELPING US THINK THROUGH HOW KIPP NEW JERSEY
 CAN CREATE A STRONG PROGRAM FOR AMERICORPS MEMBERS.
 
 C2: COMPLIANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY 
 
 KIPP NEW JERSEY WILL PUT SIGNIFICANT EFFORT INTO MAINTAINING SYSTEMS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO SEE A
 SNAPSHOT OF RESIDENTS' COMPLIANCE STANDING AND STUDENT PROGRESS AT ANY GIVEN TIME. WE WILL CREATE A
 GOOGLE-BASED TRACKING DOCUMENT THAT RESIDENTS WILL BE REQUIRED TO UPDATE ON A WEEKLY BASIS IN ORDER TO
 TRACK NUMBER OF SERVICE AND TRAINING HOURS. RESIDENTS WILL HAVE CLEAR STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT GOALS, AND
 BECAUSE WE TRACK STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT SYSTEMATICALLY AT KIPP NEW JERSEY, WE CAN CREATE A DASHBOARD
 THAT COMPILES ALL OF THE RELEVANT INFORMATION INTO ONE PLACE (SEE SAMPLE AMERICORPS RESIDENT
 DASHBOARD BELOW). THIS DASHBOARD WILL BE USED BY THE PROGRAM SUPERVISOR AND RESIDENT ADVISORS
 DURING WEEKLY AND MONTHLY MEETINGS, AND AT QUARTERLY PROGRESS CHECK-INS, SO THAT RESIDENTS ARE AWARE
 OF THEIR STANDING AT ALL TIMES.

 THE PROGRAM SUPERVISOR IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE TO CHECK FOR COMPLIANCE ISSUES OUTLINED BY
 AMERICORPS GUIDELINES AND PROVIDE REGULAR ACCOUNTABILITY FOR RESIDENTS AND RESIDENT ADVISORS. THE
 PROGRAM SUPERVISOR WILL REVIEW RESIDENT DASHBOARDS WEEKLY AND WILL MEET FOR AN HOUR MONTHLY IN
 ONE-ON-ONE MEETINGS WITH RESIDENT ADVISORS AND RESIDENTS. WHEN COMPLIANCE ISSUES ARISE, THE
 PROGRAM SUPERVISOR WILL SCHEDULE AN IMMEDIATE IN-PERSON MEETING WITH THE OFFENDER, AND PROVIDE AN
 IMPROVEMENT PLAN WITH CONCRETE STEPS AND TIMELINE REQUIRED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. RESIDENT ADVISORS
 WILL REPORT ON-THE-GROUND ISSUES AS REGARDS TO THE PERFORMANCE OF RESIDENTS. THE PROGRAM SUPERVISOR
 WILL ULTIMATELY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR TERMINATION CONVERSATIONS AND DECISIONS, SHOULD THE NEED ARISE.

 N/A
 D1 AND 2: COST EFFECTIVENESS AND BUDGET ADEQUACY 
 
 KIPP NEW JERSEY IS WILLING TO CONTRIBUTE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RESOURCES TOWARD THIS PROJECT. THERE
 ARE SEVERAL REASONS WHY WE BELIEVE THAT INVESTING MONEY INTO THIS PROGRAM WILL ULTIMATELY BENEFIT OUR
 STUDENTS, OUR NETWORK, AND THE RESIDENTS. ONE HUGE COST OF THIS PROGRAM IS PROVIDING HOUSING FOR OUR
 RESIDENTS. BASED ON OUR RESEARCH OF OTHER COMPARABLE TUTORING AND SERVICE PROGRAMS, WE BELIEVE THAT
 HOUSING IS WORTH THE INVESTMENT BECAUSE WE WILL YIELD HIGHER CALIBER RECRUITERS. BASED ON OUR RESEARCH,
 HIGH QUALITY, MISSION-ALIGNED TUTORS IS ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS THAT DETERMINE THE QUALITY OF THE SUPPORT
 FOR OUR STUDENTS. MOREOVER, WE ARE PUTTING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RESOURCES INTO THE TRAINING THAT
 OUR RESIDENTS WILL RECEIVE FROM RELAY. THIS INVESTMENT IS WORTHWHILE BECAUSE IT WILL YIELD HIGHER
 QUALITY INTERVENTION SERVICES AND ULTIMATELY SERVE MORE STUDENTS. FINALLY, IT IS OUR GOAL THAT THE
 MAJORITY OF THESE RESIDENTS WILL CHOOSE TO STAY IN EDUCATION AFTER THEIR SERVICE YEAR, PREFERABLY AT KIPP
 NEW JERSEY. WE BELIEVE THAT BE INVESTING IN THEM NOW, WE WILL CREATE A PIPELINE OF MISSION-DRIVEN,
