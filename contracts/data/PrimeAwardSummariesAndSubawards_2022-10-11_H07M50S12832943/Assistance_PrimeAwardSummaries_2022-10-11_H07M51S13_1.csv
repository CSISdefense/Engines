WHILE MODELBASED AND DATA-DRIVEN METHODS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED TO PREDICT THE RUL OF AIRCRAFT ENGINES  LITTLE RESEARCH HAS BEEN REPORTED ON ESTIMATING THE RUL OF AIRCRAFT ENGINES USING ENSEMBLE LEARNING. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AN ENSEMBLE LEARNING-BASED APPROACH TO DEGRADATION MODELING AND PROGNOSTICS OF FAILURES IN AIRCRAFT ENGINES. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL  THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES INCLUDE: (1) INTRODUCING A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH FOR SELECTING THE BASE LEARNERS OF AN ENSEMBLE; AND (2) EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF BASE LEARNER DIVERSITY ON PREDICTION ACCURACY. ENSEMBLE LEARNING METHODS ARE META-ALGORITHMS THAT COMBINE MULTIPLE BASE LEARNERS INTO A SINGLE PREDICTIVE MODEL IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE ROBUSTNESS AND ACCURACY OF PREDICTIVE MODELS. ENSEMBLE LEARNING METHODS ARE CLASSIFIED INTO TWO CATEGORIES: PARALLEL AND SEQUENTIAL ENSEMBLE METHODS. THE PARALLEL ENSEMBLE METHODS SUCH AS RANDOM FORESTS BUILD MULTIPLE BASE LEARNERS INDEPENDENTLY AND THEN AVERAGE THEIR PREDICTIONS OR TAKE A WEIGHTED SUM OF THEIR PREDICTIONS. IN CONTRAST  SEQUENTIAL ENSEMBLE METHODS SUCH AS ADABOOST CONSTRUCT BASE LEARNERS SEQUENTIALLY AND THEN REDUCE THE BIAS OF THE COMBINED BASE LEARNERS. THE PARALLEL ENSEMBLE METHOD WILL BE USED TO DEVELOP THE ENSEMBLE LEARNING ALGORITHM. THE PRIMARY RESEARCH TASKS INCLUDE: (1) SELECTING MULTIPLE HETEROGENEOUS BASE LEARNERS; (2) COMBINING THE HETEROGENEOUS BASE LEARNERS INTO A SINGLE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM USING A WEIGHTED AVERAGING METHOD; (3) TRAINING AND VALIDATING PREDICTIVE MODELS ON THE TRAINING AND TEST DATASETS (FD001  FD002  FD003  FD004  AND PHM2008 DATASETS) GENERATED BY THE COMMERCIAL MODULAR AERO-PROPULSION SYSTEM SIMULATION (C-MAPSS) TOOL; (4) COMPARING THE PERFORMANCE OF BASE LEARNERS WITH THAT OF THE ENSEMBLE; AND (5) COMPARING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PREDICTIVE MODEL TRAINED BY THE ENSEMBLE LEARNING ALGORITHM WITH EXISTING METHODS.

SPECIFICALLY  THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES TOPIC: REMOTE SENSING AS A CATALYST FOR LARGE-SCALE CONSERVATION. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES (UCLA) AND THE UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY (USGS) HAVE PARTNERED WITH THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT (BLM)  WHO WILL BE THE END-USER ORGANIZATION OF THE PRODUCTS AND TOOLS PRODUCED DURING THE PROPOSED WORK. AS STEWARD OF OVER 245 MILLION ACRES OF LAND ACROSS THE WESTERN US  THE BLM IS TASKED WITH CONSERVATION OF ANIMALS AND THEIR HABITAT ACROSS THESE VAST PUBLIC LANDS. SEVERAL ENDANGERED OR AT RISK ANIMAL SPECIES ARE PRESENT ON BLM LAND  INCLUDING THE MOJAVE DESERT TORTOISE (GOPHERUS AGASSIZII  ENDANGERED)  GREATER SAGE GROUSE (CENTROCERCUS UROPHASIANUS  AT RISK) AND BIGHORN SHEEP (OVIS CANADENSIS  AT RISK). CONSERVATION OF THESE SPECIES AND THEIR HABITAT ARE A CRITICAL MISSION OF THE BLM. IN RESPONSE TO THESE  AND OTHER  NEEDS THE BLM HAS EMBARKED UPON LARGE-SCALE COLLECTION OF FIELD DATA THAT ARE CRITICALLY RELATED TO PLANT AND ANIMAL HABITAT NEEDS: THE ASSESSMENT  INVENTORY  AND MONITORING (AIM) PROGRAM. ALTHOUGH THE AIM PROGRAM EXPLICITLY CALLS FOR A REMOTE SENSING COMPONENT  THE AGENCY HAS NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO FULLY IMPLEMENT REMOTE SENSING STRATEGIES THAT WILL AID IN MAKING LARGE-SCALE MANAGEMENT DECISIONS THAT IMPACT SPECIES HABITAT AND  SPECIFICALLY  HABITAT CONNECTIVITY. THE PROPOSED WORK SERVES AS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE BLM TO PARTNER WITH ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE EXPERTISE IN EARTH SURFACE REMOTE SENSING AND RANGELAND ECOLOGY TO FULFILL ITS MANDATED CONSERVATION GOALS  INCLUDING MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENT OF HABITAT CONNECTIVITY FOR BOTH PLANTS AND ANIMALS. THE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO PRODUCE A WEB-BASED FRONT END TOOL THAT USES GOOGLE EARTH ENGINE (GEE) TO PRODUCE ON-THE-FLY SATELLITE DATA-DERIVED ESTIMATES OF KEY AIM VARIABLES. THESE TOOLS WILL BE ACCESSIBLE TO BLM FIELD OFFICE STAFF  STATE AND NATIONAL BLM TECHNICAL ADVISORS  POLICY MAKERS  AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES. THIS TOOL WILL BE USED BY BLM AND OTHER END-USERS IN MANAGEMENT DECISION-MAKING; THE USE OF THIS KIND OF DATA FOR DECISION MAKING IS ALREADY A KEY PART OF BLM S MANDATE. THE TOOLS WE PRODUCE WILL BE BASED UPON RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN AIM FIELD DATA-DERIVED ECOSYSTEM INDICATORS AND NASA EARTHOBSERVING SATELLITE DATA THAT HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED AND WILL BE FURTHER REFINED DURING THE FIRST YEAR-AND-A-HALF OF THE PROJECT. THE VERY HIGH VOLUME OF HIGH QUALITY FIELD DATA COLLECTED UNDER AIM WILL ALLOW THOROUGH UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS OF THE DERIVED RELATIONSHIPS  THUS PROVIDING PARALLEL CONFIDENCE MAPS TO GIVE END-USERS THE REQUIRED TOOLS (BOTH VALUES AND UNCERTAINTIES) UPON WHICH TO MAKE MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE BLM END-USERS DURING THE SECOND YEAR OF THE PROJECT  WE WILL DEVELOP AN INTERFACE THAT IS DESIGNED FOR THEIR NEEDS. THE FINAL YEAR-AND-A-HALF OF THE PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON TESTING AND REFINING THE GEE-DEPENDENT INTERFACE  INDEPENDENT TESTING OF DATA PRODUCTS USING EXISTING HIGH SPATIAL-RESOLUTION IMAGERY AND EXISTING BLM PROTOCOLS  AND PRODUCTION OF DEPLOYMENT DOCUMENTS FOR THE BLM.,NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,H,PUBLIC/STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_NNX17AG50G_8000/,2021-03-05 17:22:48.198355+00

IN THESE SYSTEMS  DROPLETS IN THE SPRAY OFTEN EVAPORATE AND BURN IN AN AMBIENT AT PRESSURES AND TEMPERATURES WELL ABOVE THE CRITICAL STATE OF THE FUEL. HOWEVER  THERE IS VERY LITTLE FUNDAMENTAL INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE COMBUSTION OF LIQUID FUELS AT ELEVATED PRESSURES. THE MICROGRAVITY ENVIRONMENT ACHIEVED IN A DROP TOWER FACILITY PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVEAL THE FUNDAMENTAL INFORMATION ABOUT LIQUID FUEL COMBUSTION AT HIGH PRESSURES THAT IS NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. HIGH PRESSURE COMBUSTION RESEARCH AT LOW GRAVITY HAS TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL TO BE APPLIED TO A WIDE RANGE OF TERRESTRIAL APPLICATIONS AS MORE FUNDAMENTAL COMBUSTION PHYSICS CAN BE REVEALED WHEN THE ADDED COMPLICATION OF GRAVITY IS ELIMINATED. THE OUTCOME OF THE PROJECT WILL BE NEW INSIGHTS ON HOW LIQUID FUELS COMBUST IN ENVIRONMENTS SIMILAR TO PRACTICAL ENGINES AND PROVIDING QUANTITATIVE RESULTS FOR GUIDING ADVANCED ENGINE DESIGNS.

THE RESEARCH IN THIS PROPOSED GENELAB DATA SYSTEM STUDY SEEKS TO EXTEND THE BIOINFORMATICS TOOL DEVELOPMENT FOR GENELAB DATA TO A CROSS-KINGDOM ARCHITECTURE. MAKING SUCH INTER-ORGANISMAL COMPARISONS POSSIBLE WILL FACILITATE MINING ACROSS THE WEALTH OF DATASETS WITHIN THE GENELAB SYSTEM AND DRIVE INSIGHTS INTO THE FUNDAMENTAL RESPONSES TO SPACEFLIGHT SHARED BY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS AS A WHOLE. THIS WORK APPROACHES SOME OF GENELAB'S CORE QUESTIONS AS TO HOW IMPLEMENTATION OF LARGE SCALE DATASET ANALYSES CAN HELP PRODUCE NEW INSIGHTS AND HYPOTHESES ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF SPACEFLIGHT ON BIOLOGY. WE HAVE DEVELOPED AN INTERACTIVE DATA VISUALIZATION AND MINING ENVIRONMENT BASED ON THE QLIK ENGINE CALLED THE TOAST DATABASE THAT COVERS ALL THE PLANT BIOLOGY DATA DEPOSITED WITHIN GENELAB. THIS APPROACH ALLOWS USERS TO MAKE INTERACTIVE COMPARISONS AND FILTERS BETWEEN DATASETS TO MINE FOR BOTH COMMON AND UNIQUE FEATURES OF THE TRANSCRIPTOMES OF THE GENELAB PLANT DATA. THE REACH OF THIS ANALYSIS HAS BEEN FURTHER EXTENDED BY INCORPORATING BOTH THE PUBLISHED DATASETS FROM OTHER SPACE AGENCIES AND UNPUBLISHED DATA SETS GENEROUSLY PROVIDED BY THE PLANT SCIENCE SPACEFLIGHT COMMUNITY. CURRENT WORK IS FOCUSED ON MAINTAINING AND EXPANDING THIS PLANT-DRIVEN DATA ENVIRONMENT AND INCORPORATING ANALYTICAL PIPELINES FOR GENE FAMILIES  ECOTYPES AND SPECIES TO MOVE TOWARDS A HIGHLY INTUITIVE ANALYSIS ENVIRONMENT.

HOWEVER  MECHANICAL PROPERTIES CONTROLLED BY MICROSTRUCTURE IN AN AM MATERIAL CAN VARY NOTABLY WITHIN A PART AND BETWEEN DIFFERENT PARTS DEPENDING ON THE PROCESS PARAMETERS  COMPOSITION OF THE FEEDSTOCK MATERIALS. THIS VARIABILITY IN MICROSTRUCTURE AND MATERIAL PROPERTIES MAKES CERTIFICATION OF CERTAIN AM PROCESS FOR A PART DIFFICULT. CURRENTLY  THE ONLY WAY TO CERTIFY AN AM PART FOR SPACE MISSION IS TO PERFORM EXTENSIVE MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROPERTY CHARACTERIZATION EXPERIMENTS  WHICH IS BOTH TIME-CONSUMING AND EXPENSIVE. IN SOME OF `PROCESS MAPPING RESEARCHES  ONLY A QUALITATIVE PREDICTION OF THE OVERALL MORPHOLOGIES  I.E.  COLUMNAR  EQUIAXED OR MIXED  IS DISCUSSED. IN ADDITION  NONE OF THESE STUDIES WAS INTEGRATED WITH MATERIALS THERMOKINETIC DATABASES FOR TEMPERATURE AND COMPOSITION DEPENDENT INPUTS. THEREFORE  THE PRESENT MICROSTRUCTURE DESIGN FOR AM PART CAN BE ONLY CLASSIFIED AS TRL (TECHNOLOGY READINESS LEVEL) 1. IN ORDER TO OVERCOME THIS ISSUE AND ENABLE A SIMULATION-BASED CERTIFICATION PARADIGM  THE PROJECT TEAM AIMS TO DEVELOP PART-SCALE PROCESS-MICROSTRUCTURE SIMULATION TOOL TO PREDICT THE MICROSTRUCTURE EVOLUTION INCLUDING PHASE STABILITY OF INCONEL 718 PROCESSED BY POWDER BED LASER FUSION PROCESS. SPECIFICALLY  THE PROPOSED PROCESS MODEL WILL FIRST PERFORM A FINITE ELEMENT BASED HEAT TRANSFER ANALYSIS OF THE AM PROCESS TO PROVIDE A RELIABLE TEMPERATURE PROFILE OVER THE ENTIRE COMPONENT VOLUME  WHICH IS THEN EMPLOYED TO PREDICT THE MICROSTRUCTURE THROUGHOUT THE PART BASED ON AN INTEGRATED MICROSTRUCTURE SIMULATION MODEL FOR COMPLEX THERMAL CYCLES. THE RESOLUTION OF THE NEWLY DEVELOPED PROCESS-MICROSTRUCTURE MODEL WILL HELP TO VISUALIZE (1) GRAIN MORPHOLOGY AND TEXTURE OF THE MATRIX PHASE  AND (2) PHASE TRANSFORMATION AND INSTABILITY OF DIFFERENT PRECIPITATES  FOR AN AM PART  GIVEN THE INPUT PROCESS PARAMETERS. THE DEVELOPED PROCESS-MICROSTRUCTURE SIMULATION TOOL WILL PROVIDE SUFFICIENTLY ACCURATE FEEDBACK TO DESIGN AND OPTIMIZE LASER PROCESSING TO IMPROVE THE AM PRODUCT QUALITY. A GREAT INTEREST OF NASA IS IMPROVING THE PERFORMANCE OF STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS FOR HIGH TEMPERATURE APPLICATIONS SUCH AS JET ENGINE PARTS  WHERE BOTH CREEP AND STRENGTH ARE CRITICAL AND NEED TO BE DESIGNED FOR. THEREFORE  THE METHODOLOGY DEVELOPED IN THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL INTRODUCE AN EFFICIENT WAY TO GOVERN THE IN-SITU MICROSTRUCTURE EVOLUTION DURING LASER PROCESS  WHICH WILL DIRECTLY DRIVE THE OPTIMIZATION FOR BETTER MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF AM PARTS. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON NASAS STRATEGIC PLAN TO EMPLOY AM TO DRASTICALLY IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE  WEIGHT  AND COST OF FLIGHT HARDWARE FOR SPACE MISSION. GIVEN THE ABILITY OF AM TO FABRICATE PARTS WITH SPATIALLY-VARYING MICROSTRUCTURAL FEATURES BY DYNAMICALLY CHANGING THE PROCESS PARAMETERS  MECHANICAL PERFORMANCE CAN BE ENHANCED SIGNIFICANTLY BY OPTIMIZING THE PROCESS AND MICROSTRUCTURE ACCORDINGLY. SERVING AS THE TECHNICAL INNOVATION ENTITIES  THE PROPOSED RESEARCH (1) INCORPORATE MATERIALS THERMOKINETICS INTO THERMAL MODELING FOR CYCLIC SUPERHEATING AND SUPERCOOLING PROCESSES; (2) DEVELOP A NEW INTEGRATED PHASE TRANSFORMATION AND GRAIN TEXTURE MODEL TO PREDICT MICROSTRUCTURE EVOLUTION UNDER COMPLEX HEATING AND COOLING CYCLES WITH HIGH FIDELITY; (3) EXPLORE SIMULTANEOUS TIME SCALE PARALLELIZATION AND ADAPTIVE MESHING TO ACCELERATE THERMAL MODELING FOR PART-SCALE PROCESS SIMULATION.

AS SUCH, NOVEL AND EFFICACIOUS BEHAVIORAL ADJUNCTS TO MOUD ARE NEEDED TO IMPROVE TREATMENT OUTCOMES. MINDFULNESS-ORIENTED RECOVERY ENHANCEMENT (MORE), A COGNITIVE-AFFECTIVE TRAINING INTERVENTION GENERATED THROUGH A NIDA-FUNDED TREATMENT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS HAS SHOWN SIGNIFICANT PROMISE, DEMONSTRATING THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS IN FOUR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) BY REDUCING OPIOID USE AND MISUSE AND MODULATING NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES DURING DRUG CUE-REACTIVITY AND NATURAL REWARD PROCESSING. HOWEVER, THE MORE INTERVENTION REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT HUMAN INTERACTION AND IS THEREFORE RESOURCE INTENSIVE. FURTHER, IN LIGHT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, PEOPLE WITH OUD MAY BE RETICENT TO ENGAGE IN FACE-TO-FACE INTERVENTIONS DUE TO THE RISK OF VIRAL SPREAD. TO OVERCOME THESE IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS AND INCREASE ACCESS TO TREATMENT, THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL DEVELOP AND TEST A VIRTUAL REALITY VERSION OF THE MORE INTERVENTION (MORE-VR) BUILT ON BEHAVR LLC'S VR EXISTING, COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE PLATFORM, THE DYNAMIC EXPERIENCE ENGINE (DXE). THE DXE USES MACHINE LEARNING TO INTEGRATE BIOMETRICS INTO THE VR EXPERIENCE TO PERSONALIZE ADDICTIONS TREATMENT, BOOSTING PATIENT ENGAGEMENT AND OPTIMIZING THE EFFICACY OF CLINICAL INTERVENTION. IN PHASE I, WE WILL DEVELOP AND TEST THE MORE-VR PROTOTYPE IN A SINGLE ARM CLINICAL STUDY OF OUD PATIENTS RECEIVING BUPRENORPHINE IN AN OPIOID TREATMENT PROGRAM (OTP), FOCUSING ON PATIENT SAFETY AND ENGAGEMENT. IF THE PROTOTYPE IS PERCEIVED TO HAVE ADEQUATE USABILITY AND NET PROMOTER SCORES, AS WELL AS TO PRODUCE IMPROVEMENTS IN PROXIMAL MEASURES OF CRAVING AND AFFECTIVE STATE, THE PROJECT WILL PROGRESS TO PHASE II. IN PHASE II, WE WILL FIRST DEVELOP THE MORE-VR MINIMAL VIABLE PROGRAM USING FEEDBACK FROM OUR PHASE I STUDY TO OPTIMIZE THE INTERVENTION, AND THEN CONDUCT A RCT OF MORE-VR VS. MOUD TREATMENT AS USUAL. OUR ROBUST AND UNBIASED RESEARCH DESIGN WILL TRIANGULATE CLINICAL OUTCOME MEASUREMENT WITH BIOCHEMICAL VERIFICATION OF ABSTINENCE, ECOLOGICAL MOMENTARY ASSESSMENTS (EMA), AND NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT OF CUE-REACTIVITY. FURTHER, WE WILL INTEGRATE THE MORE-VR PROGRAM INTO THE OTP OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT, BUILDING FAST HEALTHCARE INTEROPERABILITY RESOURCES INTERFACES TO INGEST PATIENT DATA FROM ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS (EMRS) AND TO EXPORT PATIENT UTILIZATION, ASSESSMENT, AND BIOMETRIC DATA BACK TO EMRS TO CREATE PATIENT RECORDS AND INFORM CLINICIANS OF PATIENT PROGRESS.

SMALL DRONES (2-25 KG) HAVE BEEN USED WIDELY IN VARIOUS APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS LAW ENFORCEMENT, DIGITAL AGRICULTURE, FIRE MONITORING AND PREVENTION, AND GEOSPATIAL SURVEYING/MAPPING. THESE DRONE USERS OFTEN REQUIRE LONG FLIGHT TIMES TO ADDRESS TASKS THAT CANNOT BE COMPLETED BY BATTERY-POWERED SMALL DRONES. THE PROPOSED MICRO GAS TURBINE TECHNOLOGY MAY INCREASE THE FLIGHT DURATION OF SMALL DRONES FROM 20 MINUTES TO OVER 2 HOURS, WHICH MAY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE PRACTICABILITY OF USING SMALL DRONES IN MANY APPLICATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE PROPOSED MICRO GAS TURBINES DO NOT REQUIRE A MOBILE FUEL-BASED ELECTRIC GENERATOR, WHICH AVOIDS THE FIRE HAZARD FROM LIQUID FUEL STORAGE. FURTHERMORE, THE MICRO GAS TURBINE IS CAPABLE OF WORKING IN HARSH ENVIRONMENTS, SUCH AS AT HIGH AND LOW TEMPERATURES AND IN HUMID AREAS, WHERE BATTERIES OFTEN FAIL. OVERALL, THE TECHNOLOGY UNDER DEVELOPMENT MAY ENABLE COMMERCIALIZATION OF APPLICATIONS THAT WILL BENEFIT FROM LONGER FLYING DURATION DRONES OR COMPACT POWER GENERATION IN REMOTE FIELDS. THIS I-CORPS PROJECT IS BASED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MICRO GAS TURBINE TECHNOLOGY TO ALLOW SMALL DRONE USERS TO EXTEND FLIGHT ENDURANCE BY REPLACING BATTERY POWER WITH A COMPACT TURBINE-BASED HYBRID ENERGY SUPPLY SYSTEM. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE FUEL-EFFICIENT, LIGHTER, AND SAVE SERVICE TIME/COST. THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY MAY INCREASE THE FLIGHT TIME OF SMALL DRONES BY A FACTOR OF FOUR AT 1 KG SYSTEM WEIGHT WHEN COMPARED TO THE MOST ADVANCED LITHIUM POLYMER BATTERIES.

UNDERSTANDING DIABETES DISEASE PROGRESSION AND HOW IT VARIES AMONG AMERICA’S HETEROGENEOUS POPULATION IS CRITICAL, GIVEN UNEQUAL RISKS AND OUTCOMES FOR INDIVIDUALS OF DIFFERENT RACIAL/ETHNIC GROUPS. DIABETES OUTCOME PREDICTION AND SIMULATION MODELS ALLOW PREDICTION OF A PERSON’S RISK FOR DIABETES COMPLICATIONS AND DEATH. A RECENT REVIEW OF 19 SUCH MODELS FOUND THAT THE MAJORITY—16 MODELS—RELIED AT LEAST PARTLY ON TRANSITION FUNCTIONS DEVELOPED BY THE UNITED KINGDOM PROSPECTIVE DIABETES STUDY (UKPDS). THE UKPDS DRAWS ON DATA FROM A TRIAL THAT BEGAN IN 1977 AND INVOLVED 5100 PATIENTS WHO WERE FOLLOWED FOR A TOTAL OF 89,760 PERSON YEARS. THE SAMPLE CONSISTED OF MOSTLY WHITE BRITISH CITIZENS. ONLY 8% AND 10% OF THE UKPDS SAMPLE WERE INDIAN ASIAN AND AFRO- CARIBBEAN PATIENTS, RESPECTIVELY. THE MAJOR RACIAL/ETHNIC GROUPS THAT MAKE UP THE US POPULATION WERE NOT INCLUDED, AND THE VARIABLES STUDIED IN THE UKPDS DID NOT INCLUDE ANY BEHAVIORAL DATA. LONG TERM, LONGITUDINAL PATIENT DATA ON DIABETES OUTCOMES IS COSTLY TO COLLECT AND ALL INFORMATION ON THE UKPDS OUTCOMES MODELS HAS BEEN TRANSPARENTLY REPORTED AND MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. THIS HAS LEFT THE UKPDS RISK MODELS AS THE BEST OPTION FOR MANY RISK ENGINES, DESPITE THE SMALL, DATED AND NONDIVERSE SAMPLE THAT IT IS BASED ON.  CAPITALIZING ON KAISER PERMANENTE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA (KPSC) ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHR) DATA AND LEGACY DATA SYSTEMS, WE IDENTIFIED OVER 527,000 PATIENTS WITH INCIDENT DIABETES THAT WERE DIAGNOSED AND TREATED AT KPSC FROM 1993 TO 2020. OUR SAMPLE PROVIDES MORE THAN 4.4 MILLION PERSON-YEARS OF FOLLOW UP. MORE THAN 34,000 PATIENTS COULD BE FOLLOWED UP FOR 21 OR MORE YEARS. THE INCIDENT DIABETES COHORT FROM KPSC IS 34.4% HISPANIC, 10.6% ASIAN AND 12.7% AFRICAN AMERICAN OR BLACK ALLOWING US TO UPDATE THE RISK EQUATIONS FOR ALL UKPDS OUTCOME MODELS BY MAJOR RACE-ETHNICITY GROUPS DIRECTLY RELEVANT FOR THE U.S POPULATION. THESE UPDATED MODELS WILL ALLOW US TO IDENTIFY DISPARITIES IN DIABETES, ASSURE STATISTICAL FAIRNESS, AND IMPROVE PREDICTION OF DIABETES OUTCOMES FOR DIVERSE POPULATION GROUPS.  BECAUSE DIABETES OUTCOMES ARE LARGELY INFLUENCED BY HEALTH BEHAVIORS, WE WILL ALSO ANALYZE BEHAVIORAL DATA CAPTURED IN THE EHR INCLUDING DATA ON EXERCISE AND REFERRALS TO DIABETES AND WEIGHT MANAGEMENT EDUCATION CLASSES. WE WILL USE CUTTING EDGE PARAMETRIC, SEMI-PARAMETRIC AND NON-PARAMETRIC MODELS TO RE- ESTIMATE RISK EQUATIONS USING STANDARD SPLIT SAMPLE CROSS-VALIDATION. WE WILL REPORT OUR METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS TRANSPARENTLY IN THE SAME FORMAT AS THE UKPDS.

AS FIRST STEPS TOWARDS SHORTENING DIAGNOSTIC ODYSSEYS FOR INFANTS AND TODDLERS, WE DEVELOPED RULES-BASED AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING- (NLP-) BASED ALGORITHMS TO IDENTIFY INFANTS AND CHILDREN AGED 0–3 YEARS WHO WERE TYPICALLY ILL. OUR ALGORITHMS WERE ACCURATE FOR IDENTIFY ATYPICAL ILL PATIENTS AT THESE AGES FROM ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS). COHORTS SO IDENTIFIED WERE STRONGLY ENRICHED FOR PATIENTS WHO HAD UNDERGONE GENETIC TESTING. MANUAL EHR REVIEW FOR SUCH ATYPICALLY ILL PATIENT WHO HAD NEVER BEEN EVALUATED FOR A RARE GENETIC DISEASE REVEALED THAT 52% COULD APPROPRIATELY BE REFERRED FOR SUCH AN EVALUATION.  DURING THE UG3 PHASE, WE WILL CREATE A NOVEL OUTPATIENT CLINIC, MOUNT SINAI GENETICS OUTREACH (GO), STAFFED WITH MEDICAL GENETICISTS WITH PRIOR PEDIATRIC AND INTERNAL MEDICINE TRAINING, TO EVALUATE PATIENTS IDENTIFIED BY OUR EHR PHENOTYPING ALGORITHMS. IN A PILOT STUDY, WE WILL DEPLOY RULES- AND NLP-BASED ALGORITHMS TO IDENTIFY 200 CHILDREN AGED 0-12 YEARS WITH >50% RISK OF HAVING AN UNDIAGNOSED RARE GENETIC TRAIT. WE WILL SURVEY PEDIATRICIANS AT FIVE PRACTICES FOR BASELINE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT DIAGNOSTIC ODYSSEYS AND GENETIC TESTING, PROVIDE EDUCATION ABOUT THE TOPIC AND THEN STUDY THE IMPACT OF OUR ALGORITHM DEPLOYMENT. FOR PATIENTS REFERRED TO MOUNT SINAI GO, WE WILL DETERMINE THE OUTCOMES OF CLINICAL GENETIC EVALUATIONS AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTING, INCLUDING IMPACT ON SUBSEQUENT HEALTH CARE. IN ORDER TO IMPROVE OUR EXISTING ALGORITHMS, WE DEVELOPED AN AUTOMATED ABSTRACTION ENGINE THAT IDENTIFIES PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH 164 RARE GENETIC DISORDERS WITH 83% ACCURACY. WE WILL EXPAND THIS TO MORE TRAITS AND USE THEIR EHR DATA TO IMPROVE OUR PEDIATRIC EHR PHENOTYPING ALGORITHMS. THE GOAL IS TO INCREASE SENSITIVITY, CURRENTLY AT ~25%, WITHOUT DROPPING PRECISION BELOW 50%.  DURING THE UH3 PHASE, WE WILL DEPLOY OUR OPTIMIZED RARE DISEASE-DETECTING ALGORITHMS IN A NON-ACADEMIC HEALTH CARE SETTING, MOUNT SINAI SOUTH NASSAU HOSPITAL, A NON-ACADEMIC COMMUNITY HOSPITAL SETTING WITHOUT ONSITE MEDICAL GENETIC SERVICES. OUR MODEL WILL LEVERAGE PANDEMIC-ACCELERATED EXPERTISE IN TELEHEALTH TO FACILITATE ACCESS OF UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS TO GENETICS SERVICES. OUR GOAL WILL BE TO ACHIEVE SIMILAR SENSITIVITY AND PRECISION WITH OUR PEDIATRIC ALGORITHMS AS WELL AS A COMPARABLY SUCCESSFUL REFERRAL MECHANISM. ALSO, WE WILL EXTEND OUR CLINICAL RULE-BASED AND NLP ALGORITHMS TO DETECT ADOLESCENT AND ADULT PATIENTS LIKELY TO HAVE RARE GENETIC DISORDERS AND ASSESS THE IMPACT OF OUR APPROACH ON DIAGNOSTIC ODYSSEYS. WE WILL ALTER OUR PEDIATRIC RULES-BASED ALGORITHM, FIRST TO PATIENTS AGED 12-21 YEARS AND THEN TO YOUNGER ADULTS. WE WILL LEVERAGE OUR AUTOMATED ABSTRACTION ENGINE FOR RARE GENETIC DISEASE FOR ITERATIVE IMPROVEMENTS.

THE PROJECT'S IMPACTS ARE TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR PROGRAMMERS TO WRITE SOFTWARE THAT IS MORE ROBUST, MORE SECURE, EASIER TO REASON ABOUT, AND WITH FEWER BUGS, EVEN IN APPLICATION ARENAS WHERE HIGH PERFORMANCE IS NECESSARY. THE PROJECT'S NOVELTIES ARE TWO: ITS USE OF AN ANNOTATED INTERMEDIATE REPRESENTATION, CALLED 3CPS, THAT ALLOWS FACTS DETERMINED BY PROGRAM ANALYSIS AND DECISIONS DETERMINED BY OPTIMIZATION POLICIES TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRAM'S REPRESENTATION; AND A SUITE OF HIGHER-ORDER CONTROL-FLOW ANALYSES DESIGNED TO DIRECT TRANSFORMATIONS ON PROGRAMS IN THE 3CPS FORM. THE GOAL OF THE WORK IS TO DEVELOP THE ARCHITECTURE OF A COMPILER THAT HAS HIGHER-ORDER FLOW ANALYSIS AT ITS CENTER -- TO EXPLORE THE TRANSFORMATIONS AND OPTIMIZATIONS THAT ARE ENABLED BY THIS COMBINATION OF REASONING ENGINE AND CODE REPRESENTATION. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CLASSES OF FACT ANNOTATIONS IS EXPLICIT INFORMATION ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT STRUCTURE REQUIRED TO MANAGE BINDINGS OF VARIABLES; THIS IS DESIGNED TO BE CLOSELY CONNECTED TO THE RUN-TIME MACHINE RESOURCES NEEDED FOR THESE BINDINGS (HEAP RECORDS, STACK FRAMES AND REGISTERS).

TREATMENT WITH INTRAVENOUS IMMUNOGLOBULIN (IVIG) REDUCES THE INCIDENCE OF CORONARY ANEURYSMS AND RISK OF LONG-TERM CARDIOVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS. IVIG IS RECOMMENDED TO BE GIVEN WITHIN 10 DAYS OF ILLNESS; HOWEVER ONLY 4.7% RECEIVE THE CORRECT DIAGNOSIS AT THE FIRST MEDICAL VISIT. TIMELY AND ACCURATELY DIAGNOSIS OF KD IS CRITICAL, YET THERE ISN’T A GOLD STANDARD DIAGNOSTIC TEST. A CHALLENGE OF DIAGNOSIS IS THAT THE CLINICAL SIGNS OF KD OVERLAP THOSE OF OTHER PEDIATRIC FEBRILE ILLNESSES. WE PREVIOUSLY APPLIED STATISTICAL LEARNING USING CLINICAL AND LABORATORY TEST VARIABLES TO DIFFERENTIATE KD FROM FEBRILE ILLNESSES AND VALIDATED THE ALGORITHM IN FIVE CHILDREN’S HOSPITALS IN THE US. RESULTS SHOWED ITS POTENTIAL OF BEING A COMPUTER-ASSIST TOOL OF DECISION MAKING AT POINT OF CARE IN THE SETTINGS WHERE ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY WOULD NOT BE READILY AVAILABLE. BEFORE TRANSLATION AND COMMERCIALIZATION, THE ALGORITHM NEEDS TO BE VALIDATED IN A LARGE, DIVERSE POPULATION AND INTEGRATED INTO A PATIENT SURVEILLANCE PLATFORM AS A REAL-TIME SCREENING TOOL FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO USE. IN THIS PROJECT, WE PROPOSE THREE SPECIFIC AIMS TO ADDRESS THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS THAT A KD SCREENING TOOL INCORPORATING OUR PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED AND NEWLY FOUND PATIENT-LEVEL VARIABLES IN THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD (EHR) CAN DIFFERENTIATE KD FROM CLINICALLY SIMILAR FEBRILE ILLNESSES IN AN ETHNICALLY DIVERSE PEDIATRIC POPULATION IN NEW YORK CITY (NYC). WE WILL COLLABORATE WITH HEALTHIX, THE NATION’S LARGEST PUBLIC HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE (HIE) WITH DATA OF OVER 16 MILLION PATIENTS FROM NYC. IN AIM 1, WE WILL SET UP A PEDIATRIC EHR WAREHOUSE OF PATIENTS WITH KD AND OTHER FEBRILE ILLNESSES FROM HEALTHIX NYC DATA SOURCES. IN AIM 2, WE WILL IDENTIFY FEATURES THAT ARE DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED BETWEEN PATIENTS WITH KD AND PATIENTS WITH OTHER FEBRILE ILLNESSES, AND DEVELOP AN IMPROVED ALGORITHM TO DIFFERENTIATE KD FROM OTHER FEBRILE ILLNESSES. FINALLY, WE WILL INTEGRATE THE ALGORITHM INTO THE HBI SPOTLIGHT SOLUTIONS. THE SPOTLIGHT SOLUTIONS INCLUDE A HEALTHCARE SURVEILLANCE PLATFORM WITH HIGH- CAPACITY DATA INFRASTRUCTURE AND RISK ENGINES TO OFFER AI SOLUTIONS TO PROVIDERS.

A HUMAN- MARS MISSION REQUIRES THE DELIVERY OF A HIGH PAYLOAD FROM THE ENTRY INTERFACE AT A HYPERSONIC SPEED TO A PREFLIGHT-DESIGNATED SURFACE LOCATION AT NEAR-ZERO SPEED WITH PINPOINT PRECISION. THE SUPERSONIC RETRO-PROPULSION SYSTEM REQUIRED TO DECELERATE A HUMAN-SCALE VEHICLE CONSUMES SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PROPELLANT. IT BECOMES A CHALLENGING TASK TO ACHIEVE HIGH PRECISION LANDING WHILE MINIMIZING FUEL CONSUMPTION DURING THE POWERED DESCENT PHASE. MOREOVER  THE MULTI-PHASE OPERATION (ENTRY  DESCENT  AND LANDING)  NONLINEAR VEHICLE DYNAMICS  AND MISSION CONSTRAINTS MAKE IT EVEN MORE CHALLENGING TO GENERATE ONBOARD FUEL-OPTIMAL GUIDANCE MANEUVERS TO ACCOMPLISH THE MISSION. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A HIGHLY IMPLEMENTABLE GUIDANCE APPROACH THAT OPTIMIZES THE END-TO-END COMPLETE ENTRY  POWERED DESCENT  AND LANDING (EDL) TRAJECTORIES IN REAL-TIME TO ACHIEVE THE FUEL-OPTIMAL AND PRECISE LANDING. IN PURSUIT OF THIS GOAL  THREE ESSENTIAL RESEARCH OBJECTIVES WILL BE INVESTIGATED  INCLUDING (1) DEVELOPING HIGH FIDELITY AND COMPUTATIONALLY EFFICIENT MISSION MODELS WITH BOTH CONVENTIONAL BANK-ANGLE CONTROL AND DIRECT-FORCE CONTROL MANEUVERS FOR ENTRY FLIGHT  (2) DESIGNING A FAST CONVERGING ONLINE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM BASED ON ADVANCED COMPUTATIONAL TECHNIQUES  AND (3) CONDUCTING VIRTUAL SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION  WHICH WILL JOINTLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE ADVANCES OF FUEL-OPTIMAL ENTRY AND DESCENT GUIDANCE ALGORITHMS TO ENABLE PRECISE LANDING. THE END-TO-END ONBOARD OPTIMAL MISSION PLANNING IS THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO SOLVE MULTIPHASE GUIDANCE PROBLEMS AS AN ENTIRE MISSION BASED ON A ROBUST AND SCALABLE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM. THE APPROACH WILL START WITH A NEW MODELING PARADIGM THAT UNIFIES MATHEMATICAL REPRESENTATIONS OF BOTH ENTRY AND POWERED DESCENT GUIDANCE PROBLEMS INTEGRATING VEHICLE DYNAMICS IN EACH PHASE  TRAJECTORY AND OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS  AND LANDING PRECISION REQUIREMENTS. THIS UNIQUE MODEL WILL INCORPORATE DIRECT CONTROL OF AERODYNAMIC FORCES IN ENTRY FLIGHT THROUGH MODULATIONS OF ANGLE OF ATTACK AND SIDESLIP ANGLE TO ACHIEVE ADVANCED MOBILITY. A THREE-DEGREE-OF-FREEDOM MODEL BASED ON SPHERICAL ELEMENTS WILL BE CONSTRUCTED FIRST AND THEN EXPANDED TO A SIX-DEGREE-OF-FREEDOM MODEL BASED ON DUAL QUATERNIONS CONSIDERING COUPLED TRANSLATIONAL AND ROTATIONAL MOTIONS. THE ONBOARD MISSION PLANNING SCHEME AIMS TO OPTIMIZE THE ENTIRE EDL TRAJECTORY AS A WHOLE  INCLUDING DESIGNING SIMULTANEOUSLY OPTIMAL MANEUVERS IN EACH PHASE AND SELECTING AN IDEAL INITIATION OF POWERED DESCENT. TO OVERCOME THE COMPUTATIONAL BOTTLENECK IN SOLVING LARGE-SCALE NONCONVEX OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS  THE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM WILL LEVERAGE BREAKTHROUGHS IN MATRIX DECOMPOSITION  ALTERNATING MINIMIZATION  AND CUTTING PLANE METHODS TO ACHIEVE SCALABILITY AND ROBUST CONVERGENCE. THE PROPOSED MODELING AND OPTIMIZATION METHOD WILL BE EVALUATED VIA MONTE CARLO SIMULATION  IMPLEMENTATION IN AN EXPERIMENTAL TESTBED  AND FINAL ASSESSMENT IN NASA FLIGHT SIMULATIONS.

SEVERAL DECISION SUPPORT SMARTPHONE APPS EXIST TO HELP PEOPLE ESTIMATE INSULIN DOSES BASED ON CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITOR (CGM) DATA AND FOOD INTAKE. MORE SOPHISTICATED DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS EMPLOY MATHEMATICAL MODELS OF HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY TO PREDICT FUTURE GLUCOSE LEVELS AND PROVIDE GENERALIZED INSULIN THERAPY RECOMMENDATIONS. EXERCISE IS A CRUCIAL COMPONENT OF THE LONG-TERM MANAGEMENT OF T1D, HOWEVER MANY PEOPLE AVOID PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR FEAR OF HYPOGLYCEMIA (< 70 MG/DL). WHILE CONSENSUS GUIDELINES EXIST TO HELP PEOPLE MANAGE GLUCOSE DURING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, PEOPLE STILL EXPERIENCE ACUTE COMPLICATIONS. MATHEMATICAL MODELS OF AEROBIC EXERCISE YIELD PROMISE IN PREDICTING HYPOGLYCEMIA DURING CONTROLLED IN- CLINIC EXPERIMENTS BUT DO NOT PERFORM WELL IN THE REAL-WORLD OR DURING OTHER TYPES OF EXERCISE. THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR A DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM THAT HELPS PEOPLE WITH T1D MAINTAIN SAFE GLUCOSE LEVELS AROUND EXERCISE OF VARYING TYPES. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP A DECISION SUPPORT TOOL TO HELP PEOPLE WITH T1D WHO UTILIZE CGM BETTER MANAGE THEIR GLUCOSE SURROUNDING EXERCISE. THIS TOOL WILL BE CALLED AIDES, THE ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT DIABETIC EXERCISE SUPPORT SYSTEM. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT USE OF A NOVEL EXERCISE- SPECIFIC DECISION SUPPORT TOOL, POWERED BY PREDICTIVE PHYSIOLOGICAL MODELLING, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI), AND DEEP LEARNING, CAN PROVIDE TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF HYPOGLYCEMIC EVENTS EXPERIENCED BY PEOPLE WITH T1D AROUND REGULAR PHYSICAL EXERCISE. IN OUR FIRST AIM, WE WILL DEVELOP A NEW MODEL OF RESISTANCE EXERCISE THAT DESCRIBES BOTH INSULIN- AND NON-INSULIN MEDIATED EFFECTS ON GLUCOSE DYNAMICS. WE WILL THEN CREATE A NOVEL HYBRID COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORK THAT HARNESSES AI TO AUGMENT PHYSIOLOGY MODELS OF AEROBIC AND RESISTANCE EXERCISE. THIS HYBRID FRAMEWORK, CALLED PHYSAI, WILL HARNESS REAL- WORLD, FREE-LIVING EXERCISE DATA FROM THE T1DEXI PROJECT (BIG DATA). IN OUR SECOND AIM, WE WILL LEVERAGE DECADES OF RESEARCH INTO DEEP LEARNING WITH THE BIG DATA PROVIDED BY THE T1DEXI PROJECT TO TRAIN AN AI-BASED DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM THAT GIVES TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS TO HELP USERS MAINTAIN TARGET GLUCOSE DURING EXERCISE. IN OUR THIRD AIM, WE WILL ASSESS THE SAFETY AND USABILITY OF OUR DECISION SUPPORT ENGINE IN A SMALL PROOF-OF-CONCEPT STUDY WITH HUMAN PARTICIPANTS, SUPPORTED BY THE SPONSOR. THIS WILL BE THE FIRST DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO PROVIDE TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HELP USERS MAINTAIN SAFE GLUCOSE LEVELS WHILE PERFORMING AEROBIC AND RESISTANCE EXERCISE.",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,H,PUBLIC/STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_F30DK128914_7529/,2022-07-21 13:20:24.807976+00

FAST-CHARGING CAPABILITY, AS ONE OF THE KEY FEATURES OF ENERGY STORAGE DEVICES, HAS DRAWN EXTENSIVE INTEREST. IT HOLDS GREAT PROMISE TO EXPAND OR ACCELERATE THEIR APPLICATIONS IN MANY AREAS, ESPECIALLY FOR FAST-CHARGING ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO REPLACE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE VEHICLES, AS WELL AS STABILIZING ENERGY STORAGE FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES THAT ARE INHERENTLY INTERMITTENT SUCH AS WIND AND WAVE ENERGY. HOWEVER, COMMON ENERGY STORAGE DEVICES, SUCH AS BATTERIES, HAVE EXHIBITED SEVERE DEGRADATION UNDER FAST CHARGING CONDITIONS. THIS CAREER PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A PRACTICAL METHOD TO DEVELOP FAST-CHARGING ENERGY STORAGE DEVICES BY INTRODUCING AN INTERNAL ELECTRIC FIELD IN THE ELECTRODE TO IMPROVE THE ELECTRODE KINETICS AND THE DEVICE PERFORMANCE. THE PROJECT WILL HOST BOOTCAMP TO TRAIN RURAL MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS IN DEVELOPING SCIENCE CURRICULA, EQUIPPING THEM TO DELIVER ENRICHING CLASSROOM ACTIVITIES AND LECTURES. MOREOVER, THE PROJECT WILL INVOLVE UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS PERFORMING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING RELATED PROJECTS, ESPECIALLY NATIVE AMERICANS, WOMEN, AND FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS. THE RESEARCH OBJECTIVE OF THIS CAREER PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP A NOVEL HETEROSTRUCTURE IN THE ELECTRODE TO IMPROVE THE FAST-CHARGING CAPABILITY OF ENERGY STORAGE DEVICES BY MORE THAN 10 TIMES COMPARED WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART RESEARCH STUDIES. BASED ON THE PRELIMINARY STUDIES, THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT AN INTERNAL ELECTRIC FIELD, GENERATED ON THE HETEROINTERFACES CAN ACCELERATE ION TRANSPORT, ENHANCE ELECTRODE KINETICS BY LOWERING THE ENERGY OF ACTIVATION, AND HENCE IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE UNDER FAST-CHARGING CONDITIONS. IT IS EXPECTED TO ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE AND FUNDAMENTALLY ADVANCE THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE ELECTRIC FIELD OF THE HETEROSTRUCTURE, AND THE RESULTING FAST-CHARGING PERFORMANCE AT THE ENERGY STORAGE DEVICE LEVEL. THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THOSE MULTIDISCIPLINARY FIELDS LIE IN SEVERAL ASPECTS. FIRST, A FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING WILL BE GENERATED ON THE EFFECT OF THE LOCAL ELECTRIC FIELD OF THE HETEROSTRUCTURE ON THE DIFFUSION COEFFICIENT AND ELECTRODE KINETICS. A SIMULATION MODEL WILL ALSO BE CREATED TO BE INTEGRATED WITH EXPERIMENTAL EFFORTS. SECOND, A KNOWLEDGE GAP WILL BE FILLED FROM THE MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF THE ELECTRODE TO THE FAST-CHARGING FUNCTIONALITY OF THE DEVICES. THIRD, DISTINCT FROM CONVENTIONAL NANOSTRUCTURE ENGINEERING APPROACHES IN STATE-OF-THE-ART RESEARCH STUDIES, WHICH HAVE A COMPLEX AND HIGH-COST FABRICATION PROCESS, INTRODUCING A HETEROSTRUCTURE IN THE ELECTRODE PROVIDES AN EFFECTIVE, SAFE, FACILE, AND TRANSFORMATIVE APPROACH THAT REMARKABLY ENHANCES THE CHARGE TRANSFER AND HOLDS GREAT PROMISE TO RESOLVE ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES, ?LONG CHARGING TIME,? OF EXISTING ENERGY STORAGE DEVICES. THE FUNDAMENTAL STUDY WILL ALSO OPEN A NEW DOOR TO RESOLVING ISSUES IN OTHER ENERGY DEVICES BY MODULATING THE ELECTRONIC STRUCTURES IN THE DEVICES.

IT IS NECESSARY TO REDUCE BATTERY PACK COST-PER-KWH FROM ABOUT $150/KWH IN 2020-21 TO UNDER $100/KWH ($65-70/KWH FOR MAINSTREAM ADOPTION IN THE US) TO MAKE ELECTRIC VEHICLE MANUFACTURING COST LOWER THAN THAT FOR INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE-BASED VEHICLES. CURRENT LITHIUM ION BATTERIES ARE REACHING THEIR LIMIT OF ENERGY DENSITY. AS A RESULT, NEXT GENERATION BATTERIES MUST TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NEW MATERIALS. AMONG THE VARIOUS CHOICES, LITHIUM METAL PROVIDES THE HIGHEST THEORETICAL CAPACITY AND WITH A POTENTIAL CAPACITY OF ~2X ENERGY DENSITY AT THE CELL LEVEL AND ~2X LOWER COST COMPARED TO CURRENT LITHIUM ION BATTERIES. THE GLOBAL ELECTRIC VEHICLE BATTERY MARKET IS ESTIMATED TO GROW TO ABOUT $100 BILLION IN 2025. IN ADDITION, THE ENERGY STORAGE SERVICES MARKET IS ALSO EXPECTED TO START GROWING RAPIDLY DURING THE NEXT 5 YEARS AND BEYOND. THIS PROJECT IMPROVES LITHIUM METAL BATTERIES. THE PROPOSED PROJECT FOCUSES ON DEMONSTRATING LITHIUM METAL BATTERIES USING A THIN FILM OR A COATING AS A MODULATION LAYER ON THE LITHIUM METAL SURFACE TO ACHIEVE A STABLE, RELIABLE REACTION. A LITHIUM SURFACE IS INHERENTLY UNSTABLE, WHICH LEADS UNINTENDED REACTIONS AND STRUCTURES. THESE CAN LEAD TO INNER SHORT-CIRCUIT, EARLY BATTERY FAILURE AND SAFETY HAZARD. IRREGULAR REACTIONS ALSO CAUSE PART OF THE LITHIUM METAL TO BECOME INACTIVE, LEADING TO CAPACITY DECAY AND THERMAL RUNAWAY. BY ADJUSTING THE LOCAL ELECTROCHEMICAL PROCESS THROUGH LITHIUM FLUX, THE COATING PROMOTES UNIFORM LITHIUM SURFACE REACTION. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP A SCALABLE SOLVENT-FREE, THERMALLY-ENHANCED AND FIELD-ASSISTED APPROACH TO ENGINEER THE IONIC TRANSPORT PROPERTIES OF THE COATING ON LITHIUM SURFACE. THE FLEXIBLE COATING ACTS TO INTERACT WITH THE LITHIUM SURFACE BY REGULATING HOW LITHIUM IONS PASS THROUGH IT. SUBSEQUENTLY THE PROJECT WILL SYSTEMATICALLY TEST THE PERFORMANCE OF LITHIUM METAL BATTERIES EQUIPPED WITH SUCH SOLVENT-FREE ENGINEERED INTERFACES. THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY ENHANCES THE RELIABILITY OF LITHIUM METAL BATTERIES, AND PAVES THE WAY FOR THEIR COMMERCIALIZATION.

HUMAN DECISION-MAKING IN FIELDS SUCH AS MEDICINE, COMPUTER SCIENCE, PHYSICS, AND SOCIOLOGY RELY ON STRUCTURED DATA. NETWORKS HAVE LONG BEEN COMMON MODELS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE FOR STRUCTURING DATA. HOWEVER, ONLY RECENTLY NETWORK VISUALIZATION HAS BECOME MORE COMMONLY USED TOOL; FOR INSTANCE, PUBLISHERS ARE STARTING TO USE VISUALIZATIONS OF NETWORKS IN NEWS ARTICLES. LAYERED NETWORK VISUALIZATIONS SHOW EITHER CHANGES IN NETWORKS OVER TIME OR FLOWS BETWEEN STATES. THEY HELP VISUALIZE COMPLEX DYNAMICS SUCH AS HOW WATER MOVES THROUGH THE PARTS OF A STEAM ENGINE. CREATING AN OPTIMAL LAYOUT BASED ON HUMAN READABILITY CRITERIA IS AN OPEN CHALLENGE. EXISTING ALGORITHMS CREATING VISUALIZATIONS PRIORITIZE COMPUTATIONAL SPEED OVER HUMAN READABILITY. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO CREATE GENERAL AND OPTIMAL LAYOUT ALGORITHMS FOR LAYERED NETWORK VISUALIZATIONS THAT PRIORITIZE READABILITY INSTEAD. OPTIMAL LAYOUTS ARE PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL FOR DOMAIN APPLICATIONS WHERE READABILITY IS PARAMOUNT, E.G., IN MEDICINE WHERE MISTAKES CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES. THROUGH INTEGRATED RESEARCH AND EDUCATION, THE PROJECT WILL MOTIVATE STUDENTS TO WORK ON MEANINGFUL HUMAN PROBLEMS BY COMBINING APPLIED AND BASIC RESEARCH; ATTRACT AND TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF VISUALIZATION SCIENTISTS, WITH A FOCUS ON PEOPLE FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS; AND WIDELY DISSEMINATE RESEARCH RESULTS TO HELP FUTURE RESEARCHERS AND DESIGNERS CREATE MORE EFFECTIVE VISUAL DATA EXPLORATION AND DECISION-MAKING TOOLS. THIS RESEARCH WILL ADVANCE THE STATE-OF-THE ART IN VISUALIZING LAYERED NETWORKS AND LEAD TO MORE EFFECTIVE VISUAL DATA EXPLORATION AND DECISION-MAKING TOOLS. IT WILL PROVIDE OPTIMAL LAYOUTS FOR CRITICAL TASKS AND BASELINES FOR EVALUATING LAYOUT HEURISTICS. FIVE FORMATIVE STUDIES WILL PRODUCE A CORPUS OF GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR LAYERED NETWORK VISUALIZATION WHICH WILL GUIDE FUTURE RESEARCHERS AND PRACTITIONERS.

THE MAJORITY OF RESPIRATION RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED HEAVILY ON RESPIRATION RATE AND BLOOD OXYGEN SATURATION. DESPITE BEING WELL-KNOWN, THESE ARE ONLY A SUBSET OF RESPIRATION PARAMETERS. BEYOND THAT, BLOOD OXYGEN AND CARBON DIOXIDE PARTIAL PRESSURES - CALLED BLOOD GASES - HAVE MEDICAL SIGNIFICANCE AND THE POTENTIAL OF BEING MEASURED NONINVASIVELY. THIS RESEARCH SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES A SERIOUS AND GLOBAL PROBLEM, RESPIRATION DISORDERS OF INFANTS. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR INFANT ADMISSION TO THE NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT AFTER SUCCESSFUL MEDICAL TREATMENT IN THE NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT, EARLIER DISCHARGE TO A HOME LIFE WITH REMOTE MONITORING INFRASTRUCTURES COULD IMPROVE THE SURVIVAL CHANCES OF THESE AT-RISK INFANTS. MONITORING PATIENTS WITH RESPIRATORY DISORDERS FROM A HOME SETTING COULD ENHANCE THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF INDIVIDUALS OF ALL AGES, FROM NEONATAL PATIENTS WITH DEVELOPING LUNGS TO ADULTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD), WHILE CREATING AND BRINGING NEW LARGE DATA SETS TO THE ATTENTION OF CLINICIANS. CURRENTLY, CONVENTIONAL BLOOD GAS MONITORS EMPLOYED IN CORDED-BEDSIDE EQUIPMENT CAN FIND PLACE IN CLINICAL SETTINGS. HOWEVER, A WIRELESS MINIATURIZED BLOOD GAS MONITORING SYSTEM SUPPORTED WITH COMPUTATIONAL MODELS CAN EXTEND THE USE BEYOND THE HOSPITAL FOR LONG-TERM CARE. BESIDES THESE POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO SOCIETY, THIS PROJECT ADVANCES HARDWARE-SOFTWARE CO-DESIGN FOR WIRELESS WEARABLE SENSORS. MINIATURIZED BLOOD GAS RESEARCH OFFERS UNIQUE RESEARCH EXPERIENCES FOR UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS TO UNDERSTAND TECHNICAL DETAILS OF DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES AND DEVELOP TRANSLATIONAL BIOMEDICAL SKILLS. THE INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO PURSUE CAREERS IN RESEARCH AND STEM. THE CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT ALLOWS TO INTRODUCE INTERDISCIPLINARY TOPICS AND HANDS-ON EXPERIMENTAL EXPERIENCES TO STUDENTS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A HARDWARE-SOFTWARE INTEGRATION FRAMEWORK FOR A MINIATURIZED, NONINVASIVE, WIRELESS, LUMINESCENCE-BASED OXYGEN SENSING WEARABLE DEVICE WITH AN OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE TOOLKIT. THE TOOLKIT ACCURATELY TRANSLATES THE BLOOD OXYGEN LEVELS BY UTILIZING MEASURED TRANSCUTANEOUS OXYGEN DIFFUSED THROUGH THE SKIN. WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK, COMPUTATIONAL MODELS OF OXYGEN TRANSPORT IS USED TO ITERATIVELY DESIGN AN ESTIMATION ALGORITHM FOR THE INTELLIGENT SENSOR. THIS SENSOR IS RESILIENT TO NOISE ARISING FROM INTRA- AND INTERPERSONAL VARIATIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, AND SENSOR HARDWARE OPERATIONS. THE CORE SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDE 1) THE PRESENTATION OF COMPUTATIONAL MODELS OF OXYGEN TRANSPORT INCORPORATING FACTORS AFFECTING SENSOR READINGS SUCH AS WEIGHT, AGE, GENDER, SENSOR DEGRADATION, FOR BUILDING AN ESTIMATION ENGINE, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN LITERATURE; 2) THE CREATION OF A NOVEL MINIATURIZED CUSTOM-DESIGNED WEARABLE THAT MEASURES TRANSCUTANEOUS OXYGEN; 3) THE INTEGRATION OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE ON A FLEXIBLE MINIATURIZED WEARABLE DEVICE FOR LONG-TERM COMFORTABLE WEAR; 4) THE DETERMINATION OF THE COMPUTATIONAL MODELS? ACCURACY, THE SENSITIVITY OF OVERALL SYSTEM, AND THE SPECIFICITY OF THE SENSOR BY CAPTURING THE DYNAMIC RESPIRATORY PHYSIOLOGICAL STATUS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH LONGITUDINAL DATA. THE DEVELOPED HARDWARE-SOFTWARE PLATFORM IS VALIDATED ON HUMANS.

THERE EXISTS A POPULATION OF RESOURCE RICH NEAR EARTH ASTEROIDS THAT IS FAR MORE ENERGETICALLY ACCESSIBLE TO EARTH THAN THE SURFACE OF THE MOON OR ANY OTHER BODY. THESE STEPPING STONES TO THE SOLAR SYSTEM CONTAIN MILLIONS OF TONS OF HIGHLY ACCESSIBLE RESOURCES THAT COULD PROVIDE PROPELLANTS AND OTHER CONSUMABLES TO SOLVE THE IN SPACE TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM LOVE 2014. HIGHLY ACCESSIBLE NEO RESOURCES MAY BE KEY TO OPENING THE SOLAR SYSTEM TO AFFORDABLE EXPLORATION AND LARGE SCALE INDUSTRIALIZATION. ANALYSIS IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE DEGREE TO WHICH ASTEROID ISRU CAN PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN ENABLING SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY BEYOND LEO. CAREFUL STUDY OF THE POSSIBLE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF THIS POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT NEW RESOURCE IS ALSO NEEDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR NASA MISSIONS PLANNERS. IN THE PROPOSED STEPPING STONES STUDY WE WILL ANALYZE MARKET MECHANISMS  PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERSHIPS  NON TRADITIONAL COMMERCIAL ENTITIES  ECONOMIC BENEFITS  AND COMPETITIVE STRESSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE TECHNOLOGY TO EXPLOIT NEAR EARTH ASTEROID RESOURCES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SELF SUSTAINING  REUSABLE SPACE TRANSPORTATION NETWORK.  ANY TRANSPORTATION ARCHITECTURE THAT CAN EFFECTIVELY CAPITALIZE ON NEO RESOURCES MUST INCLUDE ASTEROID ISRU TECHNOLOGY  REUSABLE SPACE TUGS  AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT USE ASTEROID RESOURCES FOR PROPELLANT AND OTHER EXPENDABLES.

THIS DELIBERATION PROCESS IS CENTRAL TO BEHAVIORAL AND COGNITIVE FLEXIBILITY BUT REQUIRES OVERCOMING A MAJOR CHALLENGE: DETERMINING WHEN TO STOP DELIBERATING AND COMMIT TO A COURSE OF ACTION. MANY MODELS THAT HAVE BEEN USED TO STUDY HUMAN DECISION-MAKING AND TO IMPLEMENT MACHINE DECISION-MAKING ASSUME THAT DECISION COMMITMENT OCCURS WHEN THE ACCUMULATED EVIDENCE REACHES A FIXED VALUE OR BOUND. THESE ?ACCUMULATE-TO-BOUND? MODELS, WHOSE DEVELOPMENT LAST CENTURY HELPED FORMALIZE AND IMPROVE DECISIONS RELATED TO CODEBREAKING, MANUFACTURING, AND OTHER REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS, HAVE ALSO PROVIDED A USEFUL STARTING POINT FOR UNDERSTANDING DECISION COMMITMENT IN THE BRAIN. HOWEVER, FIXED BOUNDS ARE MOST APPROPRIATE UNDER FIXED CONDITIONS, WHICH ARE OFTEN USED IN LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS BUT RARELY ENCOUNTERED IN THE REAL WORLD. THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO MOVE BEYOND THE ?FIXED BOUND? FORM OF DECISION COMMITMENT AND INSTEAD CONSIDER MORE FLEXIBLE WAYS THE BRAIN USES TO END DELIBERATING AND ARRIVE AT A DECISION. THE RESEARCH STARTS WITH A NEW, MATHEMATICALLY GROUNDED THEORY THAT DESCRIBES THE ADVANTAGES OF USING FLEXIBLE FORMS OF COMMITMENT UNDER CHANGING CONDITIONS. THE GOAL OF THE PROJECT IS TO USE THIS THEORY TO DESIGN AND INTERPRET EXPERIMENTS THAT WILL PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE NEW VIEW OF HOW HUMAN BRAINS COMMIT TO DECISIONS EVEN WHEN THEY ARE BASED ON DELIBERATIONS THAT OCCUR DURING UNCERTAIN AND CHANGING CONDITIONS. THIS WORK WILL PROVIDE INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING AT THE INTERFACE OF MATHEMATICS, COGNITIVE SCIENCE, PSYCHOLOGY, AND NEUROSCIENCE FOR UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS. THE TEAM WILL USE RESEARCH-RELATED ACTIVITIES TO ENCOURAGE THE PARTICIPATION OF UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS IN SCIENCE. ALSO, THE TEAM WILL DEVELOP AND DISSEMINATE RESOURCES, INCLUDING NOVEL DATASETS AND ANALYTIC TOOLS, THAT WILL BENEFIT RESEARCH AND EDUCATION IN HOW THE BRAIN MAKES DECISIONS. FINALLY, THE TEAM WILL INCREASE PUBLIC AWARENESS OF COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE AND ADDRESS THE URGENT NEED TO INCREASE SCIENTIFIC LITERACY AND UNDERSTANDING OF HOW SCIENCE CAN BENEFIT SOCIETY. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED VIA PUBLIC LECTURES, CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PROGRAM ?ENGINES OF OUR INGENUITY? BROADCAST BY NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO STATIONS NATIONWIDE, BRAIN AWARENESS WEEK ACTIVITIES, AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO A WEBSITE THAT EXPLAINS BRAIN RESEARCH TO NON-SPECIALISTS. DELIBERATIVE DECISIONS FREE THE BRAIN FROM THE IMMEDIACY OF REFLEXIVE PROCESSING BUT POSE A CRITICAL CHALLENGE: HOW DOES THE BRAIN DECIDE WHEN TO STOP DELIBERATING AND COMMIT TO A COURSE OF ACTION? OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS COMMITMENT PROCESS HAS BEEN DOMINATED BY A COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORK THAT ASSUMES DECISIONS ARE TERMINATED ONCE ACCUMULATED EVIDENCE REACHES A PREDEFINED LEVEL OR BOUND. THESE ?ACCUMULATE-TO-BOUND? MODELS HAVE CLOSE TIES TO NORMATIVE THEORY AND CAN EXPLAIN A RANGE OF BEHAVIORAL AND NEURAL FINDINGS. HOWEVER, THEY ARE OPTIMAL ONLY UNDER THE HIGHLY RESTRICTIVE CONDITIONS USED IN MANY DECISION STUDIES, IN WHICH THE INFORMATIVENESS, RATE OF ACQUISITION, AND OTHER FEATURES OF THE EVIDENCE ARE STABLE AND KNOWN IN ADVANCE. IT IS NOT KNOWN HOW THE BRAIN BALANCES DECISION DELIBERATION AND COMMITMENT MORE GENERALLY, WHEN TEMPORALLY EXTENDED DECISIONS MUST CONTEND WITH OUR DYNAMIC AND UNCERTAIN WORLD.

NUCLEIC ACIDS ARE THE NEW BITS OF THE 21ST CENTURY; THEY ENCODE OUR HEALTH AND CAN BE REPURPOSED AS ALTERNATIVE STORAGE MEDIA FOR DIGITAL DATA. HARNESSING THE INFORMATION ENCODED IN THESE BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS REQUIRES A SCALABLE WAY TO STORE AND ACCESS NUCLEIC ACIDS. FOR DECADES, WE HAVE RELIED ON ENERGY-INTENSIVE LOW-TEMPERATURE STORAGE AND EXPENSIVE ROBOTICS TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF NUCLEIC ACIDS, WHICH ARE NOT SCALABLE. THE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME OF THIS PROPOSAL IS AN ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION TO STORE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF NUCLEIC ACIDS, OBVIATING THE NEED FOR FREEZERS AND ENABLING NEW PRODUCTS THAT LEVERAGE NUCLEIC ACID MATERIALS. THE PROPOSED PROJECT WILL LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR DEVELOPING A LOW-COST SCALABLE SOLUTION FOR NUCLEIC ACID MATERIALS. CURRENT APPROACHES ARE LIMITED BY THE REQUIREMENT OF LOW TEMPERATURE TO CIRCUMVENT THE DEGRADATION OF NUCLEIC ACIDS, REQUIRING A CONSTANT SUPPLY OF ELECTRICITY AND EXPENSIVE ROBOTICS.

THE PROTEIN-MAPPING PROGRAM FTMAP IS A COMPUTATIONAL ANALOGUE OF FRAGMENT SCREENING EXPERIMENTS. ACPHARIS HAS LICENSED THE DOCKING ENGINE OF FTMAP AND DEVELOPED THE ATLAS SOFTWARE AS AN UPDATED VERSION OF THE FTMAP PROGRAM.

THE MAJOR GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP A SOFTWARE PACKAGE BASED ON ATLAS THAT, STARTING FROM THE STRUCTURE OF A TARGET PROTEIN, WILL BE ABLE TO RELIABLY SCREEN VERY LARGE VIRTUAL COMPOUND LIBRARIES FOR POTENTIAL HITS. TO ACHIEVE THIS MAJOR GOAL WE PROPOSE THE FOLLOWING DEVELOPMENTS. OUR FIRST GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY REGIONS ON THE TARGET PROTEIN THAT HAVE PREFERENCES FOR BINDING SPECIFIC FUNCTIONAL GROUPS AND TO IDENTIFY A SET OF BOUND FRAGMENTS THAT CAN BE USED AS SEEDS FOR 2D AND 3D SCREENING. THIS WILL INVOLVE FOUR STEPS. (1) DEVELOPING A HIGHER ACCURACY SCORING FUNCTION TO ENABLE DISCRIMINATION AMONG DIFFERENT FUNCTIONAL GROUPS. (2) OBTAINING GENERALIZED PHARMACOPHORE INFORMATION BY ITERATIVE MAPPING, WHERE THE INITIAL MAPPING, INDICATING PREFERENCES FOR CERTAIN FUNCTIONAL GROUPS, WILL BE FOLLOWED BY MORE FOCUSED MAPPING USING PROBES CONTAINING SIMILAR FUNCTIONAL GROUPS; (3) DESIGNING BASIC AND EXTENDED FRAGMENT LIBRARIES FOR THE TWO STEPS OF MAPPING; AND (4) IMPROVING THE FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SITE BY ADDING BINDING INFORMATION FROM THE PDB USING A NOVEL POCKET SIMILARITY ALGORITHM. ONCE EXTENDED PHARMACOPHORES ARE ESTABLISHED, WE PLAN TO USE ENSEMBLES OF BINDING FRAGMENTS AS PSEUDO-COMPOUNDS TO SEED A LIGAND-BASED SHAPE-MATCHING SEARCH METHOD TO SCREEN LARGE LIBRARIES OF COMPOUNDS BASED ON MOLECULAR SIMILARITY. THE TRADITIONAL 2D SIMILARITY SEARCH WILL BE MODIFIED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ADDITIONAL 3D INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE MAPPING. THIS WILL ENABLE SCREENING LARGER LIBRARIES AND WILL YIELD MORE SPECIFIC RESULTS THAN THE EXISTING 2D LIGAND BASED TOOLS.

A ROTATING DETONATION ENGINE (RDE) IS A PRESSURE-GAIN COMBUSTION SYSTEM THAT UTILIZES CIRCUMFERENTIALLYTRAVELLING SHOCK WAVES TO DETONATE THE PROPELLANTS. RDES ARE ESTIMATED TO HAVE SPECIFIC IMPULSES 10-15% GREATER THAN CONVENTIONAL ROCKET ENGINES. A PROPULSION TECHNOLOGY WITH A PERFORMANCE INCREASE OF THIS MAGNITUDE IS DIRECTLY APPLICABLE TO LAUNCH VEHICLES  FULFILLING THE GOAL OF TABS 1.2.4. TYPICAL RDE ENGINE DESIGNS HAVE AN ANNULAR THRUST CHAMBER TO FACILITATE THE FORMATION OF ROTATING SHOCK WAVES. THE EXHAUST FLOW LEAVES THE COMBUSTOR THROUGH THIS ANNULUS LEADING TO THE FORMATION OF A BASE PRESSURE REGION BEHIND THE CENTER-BODY OF THE RDE  WHICH NECESSITATES A NOZZLE SURFACE WITHIN THE BASE REGION TO PROPERLY EXPAND THE FLOW AND COMMUNICATE PRESSURE FORCES TO THE VEHICLE. THE ANNULAR GEOMETRY OF THE RDE NATURALLY LENDS ITSELF TO UTILIZING AN AXISYMMETRIC AEROSPIKE NOZZLE TO CAPTURE THE POTENTIAL KINETIC ENERGY LOST IN THE BASE REGION. AN AEROSPIKE WOULD NOT ONLY INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE ENGINE  BUT ALSO ALLOW THE ENGINE TO HAVE IMPROVED PERFORMANCE OVER A RANGE OF PRESSURE ALTITUDES  AN ADDITIONAL BENEFIT FOR A LAUNCH VEHICLE APPLICATION. THIS RESEARCH PROJECT FOCUSES ON INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF RDES BY USING AN AEROSPIKE NOZZLE TO FURTHER CONVERT THE IMPROVED ENERGY RELEASE FROM THE DETONATION COMBUSTION EVENT INTO USEFUL KINETIC ENERGY. THIS STUDY WOULD INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF AN AEROSPIKE NOZZLE ON THE FORMATION OF DETONATION WAVES IN THE RDE. IN ADDITION  MULTIPLE EXPERIMENTS INVOLVING CANTING THE AEROSPIKE WITH RESPECT TO THE ENGINE CENTERLINE WILL BE CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE ABILITY TO THRUST-VECTOR THE ENGINE.

THE ZWICKY TRANSIENT FACILITY IS POISED TO BE THE FIRST SURVEY TO BUILD UP A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT SAMPLE OF TDE LIGHT CURVES TO PROBE THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF SMBHS AT COSMIC DISTANCES. WITH OUR SWIFT CYCLE 12 KEY PROJECT  WE UTILIZED WITH THE UNIQUE UV AND X-RAY FOLLOW-UP CAPABILITIES OF SWIFT  AND CAPITALIZED ON THE MANAGEABLE DISCOVERY RATE OF IPTF NUCLEAR TRANSIENTS  TO PERFORM A SYSTEMATIC  AND UNBIASED FOLLOW-UP OF NUCLEAR TRANSIENTS IN ORDER TO  CLEAR THE FOG  OF NUCLEAR SNE AND FLARING AGN  AND DEVELOP AND TRAIN A REAL-TIME CLASSIFICATION ENGINE TO ENABLE PROMPT CLASSIFICATION AND FOLLOW-UP OF BONAFIDE TDES AMONG THE DELUGE OF TRANSIENTS TO BE DISCOVERED BY THE NEXT GENERATION OF OPTICAL SYNOPTIC SURVEYS.

SPACE ASSETS MAY ADDITIONALLY PROVIDE THE ABILITY TO TRACK, PREDICT, AND ULTIMATELY CONTROL THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH PHASE II PROJECT DEVELOPS A NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT ENABLES SPACE LAUNCH VEHICLES TO REENTER THE ATMOSPHERE AND LAND PROPULSIVELY SO THAT THEY MAY BE REUSED. THIS CAPABILITY HAS LONG BEEN SOUGHT BUT REMAINS UNPROVEN DUE TO THE COMBINATION OF HIGH EFFICIENCY PROPULSION, ROBUST THERMAL PROTECTION, AND LOW STRUCTURAL MASS REQUIRED FOR UPPER STAGE REUSE. THE TECHNICAL HURDLES LIE IN FINDING A SOLUTION FOR REENTRY THERMAL PROTECTION THAT CAN WITHSTAND THE STRESSING ENVIRONMENTS OF ROCKET ENGINE OPERATION AND ATMOSPHERIC ENTRY WHILE ALSO BEING LOW-WEIGHT AND LOW-COST AND NOT REQUIRING MAINTENANCE BETWEEN FLIGHTS. THE GOALS OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ARE TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THE HEAT SHIELD CONCEPT IDENTIFIED IN PHASE I, BUILDING A FULL-SCALE PROTOTYPE AND TESTING IT IN ENVIRONMENTS THAT SIMULATE BOTH THE OPERATING CONDITIONS DURING THE ASCENT PHASE OF FLIGHT AND THE HYPERSONIC PHASE OF FLIGHT DURING ATMOSPHERIC REENTRY.

BACKPRESSURE EFFECTS WILL FIRST BE RECORDED AND ANALYZED. ELECTRICAL EFFECTS OF A CONDUCTING VACUUM CHAMBER WILL THEN BE DETERMINED. WHILE A SMALL AMOUNT OF RESEARCH HAS SO FAR BEEN DONE ON THESE THRUSTERS  THIS WILL BE THE FIRST ON A PLASMA SOURCE SEVERAL CENTIMETERS IN DIAMETER. FURTHERMORE  NO RESEARCH HAS EXPLORED EFFECTS AT PRESSURES AS LOW  AND NONE HAS DETERMINED ELECTRICAL EFFECTS OF THE CHAMBER WALL. THE PLASMA SOURCE USED IN THIS RESEARCH IS THE SMALL PROPULSIVE IONIC NOZZLE EXPERIMENT (SPHINX)  A PLASMA SOURCE SEVERAL CENTIMETERS IN DIAMETER DEVELOPED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. THE EXPERIMENTS PERFORMED ON SPHINX WILL TAKE PLACE IN THE NANOSATELLITE ENGINE OPERATION VACUUM CHAMBER (NEOVAC) AND THE LARGE VACUUM TEST FACILITY (LVTF). NEOVAC IS A SMALL CHAMBER DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR TESTING THRUSTERS OF SPHINX S SIZE. LVTF IS MUCH LARGER AND HAS THE ABILITY TO REACH LOWER PRESSURES  REPRESENTING A MORE SPACE-LIKE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH TO TEST SPHINX. FIRST  A BASELINE WILL BE ESTABLISHED WITH TESTS IN NEOVAC  ITERATING ACROSS ALL POSSIBLE OPERATING PRESSURES. ION VELOCITY DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS (IVDF) AND ION DENSITY WILL BE RECORDED BY LASER INDUCED FLUORESCENCE (LIF) AND LANGMUIR PROBES  RESPECTIVELY. SPHINX WILL THEN BE MOVED TO LVTF  WHERE PRESSURE WILL BE ITERATED ACROSS THE SAME VALUES. PRESSURE WILL THEN BE LOWERED INCREMENTALLY TO THE LOWEST POSSIBLE OPERATING PRESSURE WITH IVDF AND DENSITY MEASUREMENTS TAKEN AT EACH STEP. FINALLY  A CONDUCTING PLATE WILL BE INTRODUCED INTO THE CHAMBER. LVTF WILL RUN AT HIGH VACUUM  AND THE CONDUCTING PLATE WILL BE REPOSITIONED PARALLEL TO SPHINX UNDER OPERATION. ELECTRIC POTENTIAL WILL BE TAKEN ON THE PLATE  AND THE MAGNETIC FIELD AT THE PLATE WILL BE MEASURED AT EACH STEP USING AN INDUCTIVE MAGNETIC FIELD PROBE. THIS PROCESS WILL THEN BE REPEATED WITH THE PLATE GROUNDED  AND CURRENT THROUGH THE PLATE WILL BE RECORDED. DATA WILL BE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE WHAT EFFECTS BACKGROUND PRESSURE AND CONDUCTING CHAMBERS HAVE ON MAGNETIC NOZZLE PLASMA OPERATION. WITH DATA ON BACKPRESSURE EFFECTS  THE INFLUENCE OF NEUTRAL INGESTION  CHARGE EXCHANGE COLLISIONS  AND MOMENTUM EXCHANGE COLLISIONS WILL BE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE WHERE PRIMARY INFLUENCES LIE AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THOSE INFLUENCES. IF THE THEORY BEHIND THESE THREE MECHANISMS IS INSUFFICIENT TO EXPLAIN RESULTS  THE THEORY WILL BE MODIFIED. THE EXISTENCE OF A CURRENT FREE DOUBLE LAYER (CFDL) WILL BE DETERMINED IN EACH STEP BY LIF MEASUREMENTS. THE INFLUENCE OF FACILITIES ON CFDL S WILL THUS BE DETERMINED. SMALL MAGNETIC NOZZLE THRUSTERS ARE OF POTENTIAL USE FOR CUBESAT PROPULSION. HOWEVER  LITTLE RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE EXAMINING HOW THESE THRUSTERS PERFORM IN SPACE  AND HOW THIS PERFORMANCE WILL VARY FROM GROUND TESTS. DEVELOPING THE THEORY BEHIND FACILITY EFFECTS OF THESE THRUSTERS WILL ALLOW A MORE RELIABLE PREDICTION OF SPACE PERFORMANCE  YIELDING A BROADER MISSION APPLICABILITY. ACCORDING TO NASA  FURTHER ENABLING OF CUBESAT PROPULSION IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THE FURTHERING OF OUR SPACE PROGRAM  AND THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO INCREASE THE USABILITY OF SMALL EP DEVICES ON CUBESATS. FURTHERMORE  DETECTION OF CFDL S IN THESE SITUATIONS WILL YIELD A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE SOURCE OF THESE PHENOMENA. AS AN ION ACCELERATION MECHANISM  THEY ARE RELATIVELY POORLY UNDERSTOOD AND HAVE BEEN THEORIZED TO BE SIMPLY A RESULT OF FACILITY INTERFERENCE.

VERSAL IS A MAJOR HARDWARE ADVANCE THAT ALLOWS MASSIVE STREAMS OF REAL-TIME DATA TO BE PROCESSED AT LEAST 100-FOLD FASTER THAN WITH CURRENT CPU/GPU PROCESSORS AND WITH THE POTENTIAL TO TRANSFORM HOW PROTEOMICS IS CONDUCTED. OUR CURRENT EXD VIEWER USES EFFICIENT MODERN PROGRAMMING FRAMEWORKS TO PROCESS COMPLEX SPECTRA IN MINUTES. FOR PHASE II, WE WILL PORT THE BACKEND CORE ENGINE TO RUN EFFICIENTLY ON THE POWERFUL VERSAL ACAP ENABLED- WORKSTATION. ACCOMPLISHING THIS OBJECTIVE WILL ALLOW ENTIRE FRAMES OF ION MOBILITY SPECTRA (IMS-MS) TO BE CONTINUOUSLY ANALYZED. THE VERSAL ACAP WILL ALLOW ADAPTIVE CONTROL THE EXD CELL AND MASS SPECTROMETER TO DYNAMICALLY ADJUST DATA COLLECTION TO MORE FULLY CHARACTERIZE MACROMOLECULES ON THE FLY AND TO APPLY A BROADER RANGE OF TOOLS. THE COMMERCIAL VALUE COMES FROM REDUCING BOTH SAMPLE ANALYSIS TIME AND THE NEED FOR EXPERT USER INPUT.

TO DEAL WITH THE RANGE OF USAGES, MODEL DIVERSITY HAS BEEN GROWING: FROM CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS, TO EMBEDDING TABLE-BASED RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS, TO GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS TO NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING. AS MODEL USAGE EMBEDS IN SENSITIVE DOMAINS, SUCH AS SPEECH- AND EMOTION-RECOGNITION ENGINES, DATA PRIVACY IS ALSO A KEY REQUIREMENT FOR THE NEXT GENERATION ML HARDWARE. AS THE MODEL DIVERSITY HAS GROWN, THE COMPUTE AND COMMUNICATION DEMANDS ALSO VARY WIDELY, BOTH ACROSS MODELS AND WITHIN A MODEL. AND NEW PRIVACY PROTECTING EXECUTION MODELS SUCH AS MULTI-PARTY COMPUTING (MPC) DEMAND FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT HARDWARE SUPPORT. HENCE, THERE IS A NEED TO RETHINK THE DESIGN OF ML HARDWARE ACCELERATORS FOR THE NEW ERA OF PRIVACY-PRESERVING HETEROGENEOUS MODEL USAGE. TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS, THIS PROJECT FOCUSES ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ML ACCELERATOR COHORT ARCHITECTURE (MLACA). MLACA IS COLLECTION OF HETEROGENEOUS ML ACCELERATOR TILES THAT WORK IN UNISON TO ADAPT TO THE DYNAMICALLY CHANGING ML EXECUTION DEMANDS. MLACA USES MULTIPLE RESEARCH THRUSTS TO ACHIEVE ITS GOALS: THE FIRST THRUST FOCUSES ON BUILDING A HETEROGENEOUS MLACA COMPUTE FABRIC THAT SUPPORTS A WIDE RANGE OF DENSE AND SPARSE EXECUTION PARADIGMS, INCLUDING NOVEL SUPPORT FOR PRIVATE COMPUTING. THE SECOND THRUST FOCUSES ON MLACA'S MEMORY AND ACCELERATION FABRIC THAT PERFORMS IN-MEMORY INDEXING ACCELERATION FOR EMBEDDING TABLES, PREFETCHING THAT USES PERFECT FUTURE KNOWLEDGE OF TRAINING DATA. MLACA'S COMMUNICATION THRUST FOCUSES ON DISTRIBUTED TRAINING ACCELERATION, USING TECHNIQUES SUCH AS DYNAMIC TENSOR DECOMPOSITION THAT TRADEOFF COMPUTATION AND COMMUNICATION COSTS. THE RUNTIME SYSTEM THRUST MANAGES MLACA FABRIC ALLOCATION ACROSS COMPETING ML MODELS TO MAXIMIZE THE RESOURCE UTILIZATION AND IMPROVE POWER EFFICIENCY. TECHNOLOGY TRANSITION IS PLANNED THROUGH STRONG INDUSTRY COLLABORATIONS WITH THE USC-META CENTER AND INTEL'S PRIVATE AI INSTITUTE. THIS RESEARCH USES NSF?S RESEARCH EXPERIENCE FOR UNDERGRADUATE FUNDING, AND USC'S INTERNAL SURE AND K-12 SHINE PROGRAMS TO ENGAGE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND TEACHERS, AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS IN PREPARING THEM FOR A CAREER IN ML SYSTEMS DESIGN.

DURING THIS PERIOD, THE UNPRECEDENTED ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE COMPUTER VISION DOMAIN MADE MANY BELIEVE THAT OBJECT DETECTION IS A SOLVED PROBLEM. HOWEVER, WHEN IT COMES TO SCIENTIFIC IMAGERY SUCH AS MICROSCOPIC, TELESCOPIC, AERIAL, SATELLITE, AND MEDICAL IMAGES, THE GENERAL-PURPOSE OBJECT-DETECTION ALGORITHMS ARE FAR FROM PERFECT. A PIXEL-PRECISE SEGMENTATION OF OBJECTS AND IDENTIFICATION OF THEIR PHYSICAL PROPERTIES BASED ON THEIR TEXTURE FEATURES ARE STILL OUTSTANDING CHALLENGES IN MANY INTERDISCIPLINARY AREAS OF RESEARCH. SPACE WEATHER IS ONE SUCH AREA. EXTREME SPACE-WEATHER EVENTS, SIMILAR TO EXTREME TERRESTRIAL EVENTS, CAN HAVE DRASTIC ECONOMIC AND COLLATERAL IMPACTS ON MANKIND. CONTINUOUS AND AUTOMATIC MONITORING OF SOLAR FILAMENTS PLAYS AN INTEGRAL ROLE IN ACHIEVING RELIABLE SPACE-WEATHER FORECAST/PREDICTION SYSTEMS, WHICH CONSEQUENTLY RESULTS IN THE TECHNICAL PREPAREDNESS MUCH NEEDED IN MANY INFRASTRUCTURAL ASPECTS OF THE SOCIETY, SUCH AS THE POWER GRID AND THE GPS SYSTEMS. OUR MACHINE LEARNING ECOSYSTEM BRINGS AUTOMATIC, ACCURATE, AND RELIABLE ANALYSES OF FILAMENTS? DYNAMIC BEHAVIOR TO THE EXPERTS? FINGERTIPS. THE MAIN CONTRIBUTIONS OF THIS ECOSYSTEM ARE TWO DATA PRODUCTS OF ANNOTATED FILAMENTS, AND FOUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS WHICH CARRY OUT THE ANNOTATION (LOCALIZATION, IDENTIFICATION, AND SEGMENTATION) OF THESE FILAMENTS. THIS MODULAR ECOSYSTEM CAN BE EASILY EXPANDED IN THE FUTURE, BEYOND THE LIFETIME OF THE AWARD, AS FASTER AND MORE EFFICIENT MODULES ARE EXPECTED TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE COMMUNITY AND REPLACE THE EXISTING ONES. THROUGHOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PROJECT, WE CONSULT WITH THE INSTRUMENT/DATA EXPERTS FROM THE NATIONAL SOLAR OBSERVATORY (NSO) FOR PROPER UTILIZATION OF THE OBSERVATION IMAGES AND METADATA WE INTEGRATE FROM THE SIX GROUND-BASED OBSERVATORIES OF THE GLOBAL OSCILLATION NETWORK GROUP, THAT TOGETHER PROVIDE A FULL-DISK AND CONTINUOUS (24/7) COVERAGE OF THE SUN. THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF THIS PROJECT IS ON THE LOCALIZATION AND SEGMENTATION OF A SPECIFIC SOLAR EVENT, CALLED A FILAMENT, AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF ITS MAGNETIC FIELD CHIRALITY. THAT SAID, THE NOVEL CONCEPTS INVESTIGATED IN THIS PROJECT, SUCH AS THE DETECTION ALGORITHM, THE AUGMENTATION ENGINE, AND THE SEGMENTATION LOSS FUNCTION WHICH IS SENSITIVE TO GRANULARITIES OF OBJECTS, REMAIN AGNOSTIC TO THE TYPE OF THE EVENT/OBJECT OF INTEREST. MOREOVER, THE RELEASED DATASETS OF ANNOTATED FILAMENTS CAN SERVE THE COMPUTER VISION COMMUNITY AS A TESTBED FOR ALGORITHMS THAT AIM AT HIGH-PRECISION SEGMENTATION OF OBJECTS. OUR MACHINE LEARNING ECOSYSTEM CONSISTS OF TWO DATA PRODUCTS AND FOUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. THE LARGEST COLLECTION OF MANUALLY ANNOTATED FILAMENTS DATA, AND A CONTINUOUSLY-GROWING COLLECTION OF AUTOMATICALLY ANNOTATED FILAMENTS ARE THE TWO MAIN DATA PRODUCTS. THE MAIN SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ARE (1) AN AUGMENTATION ENGINE THAT PROVIDES USERS WITH PRACTICALLY UNLIMITED SEMI-REAL FILAMENT INSTANCES, (2) A DEEP NEURAL NETWORK ALGORITHM FOR LOCALIZATION, SEGMENTATION, AND CLASSIFICATION OF FILAMENTS, (3) A HIGH-PRECISION SEGMENTATION LOSS FUNCTION (SENSITIVE TO GRANULARITIES OF THE OBSERVED FILAMENTS) THAT GUIDES THE SEGMENTATION TASK, AND (4) A DEPLOYABLE DETECTION MODULE WHICH CARRIES OUT THE LOCALIZATION, SEGMENTATION, AND CLASSIFICATION TASKS IN REAL TIME.

TO MEET THIS OBJECTIVE, WE PROPOSE TO INCORPORATE SEVERAL NOVEL OCT COMPONENTS AND TECHNIQUES INTO A NEW OCTA INSTRUMENT WHICH CAN BE APPLIED IN RESEARCH STUDIES AND OFFERS A PATHWAY FOR COMMERCIALIZATION AND CLINICAL USE. THIS IMAGING SYSTEM WILL USE THE AGILE DESIGN CAPABILITIES OF OUR LOW COST OCT ENGINE, WHICH HAS ENABLED US TO OFFER THE FIRST COMMERCIAL OCT RESEARCH SYSTEM FOR SALE AT A PRICE UNDER $10,000. FOR THIS PROJECT WE WILL IMPLEMENT FASTER SCANNING, UP TO A-SCAN RATES OF 80 KHZ, IMPLEMENT SCAN PATTERNS THAT ENHANCE EFFICIENCY OF OCTA SCAN ACQUISITION AND EXPAND THE SPECTRAL RANGE OF OUR OCT SYSTEM TO PERMIT USE OF SPECTROSCOPIC INFORMATION TO MEASURE BLOOD OXYGENATION. OCTA HAS SEEN THE MOST INTEREST IN ASSESSING RETINAL VASCULATURE AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO FLUORESCEIN ANGIOGRAPHY (FA) AS IT AVOIDS THE NEED FOR A FLUORESCENT CONTRAST AGENT. LOW COST OCTA COULD EXPAND APPLICATION OF THE TECHNIQUE BEYOND DIAGNOSIS OF RETINAL DISEASE IN PATIENTS WITH SYMPTOMS TO INCLUDE WIDER PATIENT SCREENING. FOR THIS PROJECT, WE ARE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING USE CASES FOR OCTA IN FIELDS BEYOND OPHTHALMOLOGY, INCLUDING ASSESSING TISSUE PERFUSION AND NEUROLOGICAL DEFECTS. WE SEEK TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF A LOW COST OCTA SYSTEM THAT IS SUITABLE FOR COMMERCIALIZATION. TO REACH THIS GOAL, THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS ARE PROPOSED: 1. DEVELOPMENT OF LOW COST OCTA ENGINE AND ANALYSIS SOFTWARE. 2. ADDING SPECTROSCOPIC INFORMATION TO OCTA AND 3. TEST AND VALIDATE OCTA SYSTEM WITH IN VIVO PILOT STUDIES.

THIS DELIBERATION PROCESS IS CENTRAL TO BEHAVIORAL AND COGNITIVE FLEXIBILITY BUT REQUIRES OVERCOMING A MAJOR CHALLENGE: DETERMINING WHEN TO STOP DELIBERATING AND COMMIT TO A COURSE OF ACTION. MANY MODELS THAT HAVE BEEN USED TO STUDY HUMAN DECISION-MAKING AND TO IMPLEMENT MACHINE DECISION-MAKING ASSUME THAT DECISION COMMITMENT OCCURS WHEN THE ACCUMULATED EVIDENCE REACHES A FIXED VALUE OR BOUND. THESE ?ACCUMULATE-TO-BOUND? MODELS, WHOSE DEVELOPMENT LAST CENTURY HELPED FORMALIZE AND IMPROVE DECISIONS RELATED TO CODEBREAKING, MANUFACTURING, AND OTHER REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS, HAVE ALSO PROVIDED A USEFUL STARTING POINT FOR UNDERSTANDING DECISION COMMITMENT IN THE BRAIN. HOWEVER, FIXED BOUNDS ARE MOST APPROPRIATE UNDER FIXED CONDITIONS, WHICH ARE OFTEN USED IN LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS BUT RARELY ENCOUNTERED IN THE REAL WORLD. THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO MOVE BEYOND THE ?FIXED BOUND? FORM OF DECISION COMMITMENT AND INSTEAD CONSIDER MORE FLEXIBLE WAYS THE BRAIN USES TO END DELIBERATING AND ARRIVE AT A DECISION. THE RESEARCH STARTS WITH A NEW, MATHEMATICALLY GROUNDED THEORY THAT DESCRIBES THE ADVANTAGES OF USING FLEXIBLE FORMS OF COMMITMENT UNDER CHANGING CONDITIONS. THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS (PIS) THEN USE THIS THEORY TO DESIGN AND INTERPRET EXPERIMENTS THAT WILL PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE NEW VIEW OF HOW HUMAN BRAINS COMMIT TO DECISIONS EVEN WHEN THEY ARE BASED ON DELIBERATIONS THAT OCCUR DURING UNCERTAIN AND CHANGING CONDITIONS. THIS WORK WILL PROVIDE INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING AT THE INTERFACE OF MATHEMATICS, COGNITIVE SCIENCE, PSYCHOLOGY, AND NEUROSCIENCE FOR UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS. THE PIS WILL USE RESEARCH-RELATED ACTIVITIES TO ENCOURAGE THE PARTICIPATION OF UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS IN SCIENCE. ALSO, THE PIS WILL DEVELOP AND DISSEMINATE RESOURCES, INCLUDING NOVEL DATASETS AND ANALYTIC TOOLS, THAT WILL BENEFIT RESEARCH AND EDUCATION IN HOW THE BRAIN MAKES DECISIONS. FINALLY, THE PIS WILL INCREASE PUBLIC AWARENESS OF COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE AND ADDRESS THE URGENT NEED TO INCREASE SCIENTIFIC LITERACY AND UNDERSTANDING OF HOW SCIENCE CAN BENEFIT SOCIETY. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED VIA PUBLIC LECTURES, CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PROGRAM ?ENGINES OF OUR INGENUITY? BROADCAST BY NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO STATIONS NATIONWIDE, BRAIN AWARENESS WEEK ACTIVITIES, AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO A WEBSITE THAT EXPLAINS BRAIN RESEARCH TO NON-SPECIALISTS. DELIBERATIVE DECISIONS FREE THE BRAIN FROM THE IMMEDIACY OF REFLEXIVE PROCESSING BUT POSE A CRITICAL CHALLENGE: HOW DOES THE BRAIN DECIDE WHEN TO STOP DELIBERATING AND COMMIT TO A COURSE OF ACTION? OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS COMMITMENT PROCESS HAS BEEN DOMINATED BY A COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORK THAT ASSUMES DECISIONS ARE TERMINATED ONCE ACCUMULATED EVIDENCE REACHES A PREDEFINED LEVEL OR BOUND. THESE ?ACCUMULATE-TO-BOUND? MODELS HAVE CLOSE TIES TO NORMATIVE THEORY AND CAN EXPLAIN A RANGE OF BEHAVIORAL AND NEURAL FINDINGS. HOWEVER, THEY ARE OPTIMAL ONLY UNDER THE HIGHLY RESTRICTIVE CONDITIONS USED IN MANY DECISION STUDIES, IN WHICH THE INFORMATIVENESS, RATE OF ACQUISITION, AND OTHER FEATURES OF THE EVIDENCE ARE STABLE AND KNOWN IN ADVANCE. IT IS NOT KNOWN HOW THE BRAIN BALANCES DECISION DELIBERATION AND COMMITMENT MORE GENERALLY, WHEN TEMPORALLY EXTENDED DECISIONS MUST CONTEND WITH OUR DYNAMIC AND UNCERTAIN WORLD. THE GOAL IS TO ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE DECISION RULES USED BY THE BRAIN UNDER THESE CONDITIONS. THE PIS START WITH A NOVEL THEORETICAL FOUNDATION THAT INCLUDES FLEXIBLE DECISION BOUNDS THAT ARE NOT PREDEFINED BUT INSTEAD CAN BE UPDATED WHILE THE DECISION IS BEING FORMED TO OPTIMIZE PERFORMANCE EVEN UNDER CHANGING CONDITIONS. THEY USE THIS FRAMEWORK TO GUIDE THE DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF BEHAVIORAL STUDIES IN HUMANS AND COMBINE BEHAVIORAL AND NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL STUDIES IN NON-HUMAN PRIMATES, WHICH THEY USE TO TEST THEIR PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS THAT THE PRIMATE BRAIN USES DYNAMIC, ADAPTIVE RULES TO SUPPORT RATIONAL DECISION-MAKING IN CHANGING AND UNCERTAIN ENVIRONMENTS.

WE WILL USE STATE-OF-THE-ART ATMOSPHERIC MODELING AND ADJOINT METHODS TO ESTIMATE BOTH ABSOLUTE IMPACTS AND SENSITIVITIES TO PARAMETERS INCLUDING FLEET SIZE  AIRCRAFT PERFORMANCE AND EMISSIONS  FUEL PROPERTIES  AND ROUTE SELECTION. THE MODELS WE WILL DEVELOP IN ORDER TO ASSESS THESE IMPACTS WILL COMPRISE A SUITE OF FLEXIBLE AND POWERFUL RAPID DESIGN AND ASSESSMENT TOOLS ALLOWING FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF SUPERSONIC AIRCRAFT AS WELL AS MORE GENERAL ATMOSPHERIC IMPACT ASSESSMENT. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES  WE HAVE GATHERED A TEAM WITH INTERNATIONALLY-RECOGNIZED EXPERTISE IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE  CLIMATE SCIENCE  AVIATION S ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS  AND THE MODELS REQUIRED TO EFFICIENTLY STUDY THESE SYSTEMS. ASSESSING THE OZONE AND CLIMATE IMPACTS OF SUPERSONIC AIRCRAFT REQUIRES AN INTEGRATED APPROACH THAT INVOLVES INTERACTIONS AMONG SEVERAL COMPONENT MODELS  WHICH WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY USED TO ASSESS AVIATION S ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. FOR THIS STUDY  WE WILL IMPROVE THESE TOOLS TO REPRESENT THE EFFECTS OF SUPERSONIC  STRATOSPHERIC FLIGHT AND IMPLEMENT EFFICIENT NUMERICAL METHODS TO ASSESS MODEL SENSITIVITIES TO INPUT PARAMETERS. WE WILL USE OUR EXPERIENCE MODELING AND IMPLEMENTING STRATOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY IN THE GEOS-CHEM UCX 3D CHEMICAL-TRANSPORT MODEL TO FURTHER ADVANCE MODELING OF THE IMPACT OF AIRCRAFT FLYING IN THE STRATOSPHERE. SPECIFIC FOCUS AREAS WILL INCLUDE IMPROVING THE TREATMENT OF WATER INTRODUCED IN THE STRATOSPHERE BY HIGH-ALTITUDE AIRCRAFT AND EXTENDING HETEROGENEOUS REACTION MECHANISMS TO INCLUDE CHEMISTRY ON HYDROPHILIC CARBONACEOUS AEROSOLS. IN ADDITION TO THE DIRECT INTERACTIONS OF AVIATION NOX WITH THE OZONE CYCLE  WE ANTICIPATE ADDITIONAL OZONE EFFECTS DUE TO INTERACTIONS BETWEEN AVIATION EMISSIONS AND CHLORINE ACTIVATION  AND INDIRECT CLIMATE EFFECTS DUE TO OXIDATION OF ATMOSPHERIC METHANE. WE WILL IMPLEMENT AN ADJOINT MODEL OF GEOS-CHEM UCX IN ORDER TO EFFICIENTLY ASSESS A WIDE RANGE OF EMISSIONS AND ROUTE SELECTION SCENARIOS. A SINGLE ADJOINT MODEL RUN WILL PROVIDE THE SENSITIVITY COEFFICIENTS NEEDED TO COMPUTE FIRST-ORDER ESTIMATES FOR CHANGES TO MEAN OZONE CONCENTRATION  POPULATION EXPOSURE TO UV  AND GLOBAL RADIATIVE FORCING FOR ANY FLEET AND EMISSIONS SCENARIO  INCLUDING THE EVALUATION OF IMPACTS FROM INDIVIDUAL ROUTES AND THE EFFECT OF INDIVIDUAL DESIGN DECISIONS. WE WILL ALSO INCORPORATE THE CLIMATE IMPACT RESULTING FROM DIFFERENCES IN CONTRAIL FORMATION BETWEEN HIGH-ALTITUDE SUPERSONIC AIRCRAFT AND CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT BY EXTENDING OUR EXISTING CONTRAIL MODEL TO STRATOSPHERIC ALTITUDES AND INTRODUCING MICROPHYSICAL MODELS FOR HETEROGENEOUS NUCLEATION OF MIXED WATER/SULFURIC ACID VAPOR AND HOMOGENEOUS NUCLEATION OF ICE CRYSTALS. SIMPLIFIED CHEMICAL KINETIC MODELS OF SUPERSONIC CRUISE AIRCRAFT ENGINES WILL BE EMPLOYED TO ESTIMATE EMISSIONS PROFILES FOR BLACK CARBON  NOX  SOX  AND OTHER SPECIES AFFECTING ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND RADIATIVE TRANSFER. THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE JET FUELS  INCLUDING LOW-SULFUR  LOW AROMATICS FUELS PRODUCED BY HEFA AND FISCHER-TROPSCH PROCESSES WILL BE MODELED BY INCORPORATING DATA FROM EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENTS WITH THE ENGINE MODEL. WE WILL ALSO CONSIDER SCENARIOS FOR POSSIBLE LNG-FUELED AIRCRAFT WHICH COULD OFFER SIMILAR EMISSIONS BENEFITS. THE IMPACT OF SUPERSONIC CRUISE AIRCRAFT WILL DEPEND ON THE ROUTES AND SCHEDULES OF THOSE AIRCRAFT. WE WILL IDENTIFY A SET OF PHYSICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE ROUTES BASED ON INSIGHTS FROM FLEET ASSIGNMENT MODELS  IN WHICH AIRCRAFT ARE ASSIGNED TO ROUTES SO AS TO MAXIMIZE NETWORK PROFITABILITY. WE WILL DEVELOP AND ASSESS SCENARIOS FOR CHANGES IN FLEET ASSIGNMENTS IN WHICH PROPORTIONS OF FLIGHTS ARE REPLACED WITH SUPERSONIC AIRCRAFT  AS WELL AS SCENARIOS IN WHICH SUPERSONIC AIRCRAFT SERVE AS A SUPPLEMENT TO THE SUBSONIC FLEET.,NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,O,PRIVATE INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_NNX14AT22A_8000/,2020-11-05 12:46:24.975101+00

HYDROGEN FIRE DETECTION IS CRITICAL FOR ROCKET PROPULSION SAFETY AND MAINTENANCE. A SIGNIFICANT FIRE AT A ROCKET TEST OR LAUNCH FACILITY COULD BE CATASTROPHIC TO INFRASTRUCTURE OR EVEN WORSE  TO HUMAN LIFE. DETECTION MONITORING IS PROBLEMATIC AS HYDROGEN FLAMES CAN BE NEARLY INVISIBLE DURING THE DAY. NONIMAGING  NONVISIBLE FIRE DETECTION TECHNOLOGY HAS LIMITED RANGE AND CAN SUFFER FROM FALSE ALARMS FROM SOURCES OUTSIDE THE REGION OF INTEREST. LOWCOST VISIBLE IMAGERS  COMMONLY USED FOR WIDESCALE ROUTINE SURVEILLANCE  HAVE LIMITED UTILITY DETECTING HYDROGEN FIRES. ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR DECADES THAT MULTISPECTRAL IMAGING OUTSIDE THE VISIBLE RANGE CAN BE USED TO DETECT FIRES WITH LOW FALSE ALARM RATES  THE PRICE OF SUCH SYSTEMS AND THE LACK OF PROCESSING ALGORITHMS AND THE ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT THEM IN REALTIME HAS LARGELY PROHIBITED THEIR USE.

AS APPLIED TO THE OPERATION OF QUANTUM OTTO ENGINES, THE HUNT-GROUP THEORY IS KNOWN TO PRODUCE DIFFERENCES FROM PREVIOUS THEORIES IN THE QUANTUM-STATE OCCUPANCIES AT THE END OF THE POWER STROKE; IT IS EXPECTED TO PREDICT DIFFERENCES IN THE OVERALL ENGINE EFFICIENCY, SURPASSING THE CARNOT LIMITS.

REASONING ABOUT SPACE IS FUNDAMENTAL TO TASKS RANGING FROM ENGINE REPAIR AND MOVING FURNITURE TO MULTIVARIABLE CALCULUS, LINEAR ALGEBRA, AND OTHER ADVANCED AREAS OF MATHEMATICS. IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD, SPATIAL REASONING IS LINKED TO PHYSICAL MOVEMENT, SUCH AS TURNING ONE?S HEAD TO GET A DIFFERENT VIEW OF AN ASSEMBLY OR ROTATING AN OBJECT IN SPACE TO FIT IT AROUND A CORNER. IN THE REALM OF MATHEMATICS, SPATIAL REASONING IS ASSOCIATED WITH MENTAL MANIPULATIONS OF TWO-DIMENSIONAL DIAGRAMS. THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE STRATEGIES USED TO EXPLORE THE WORLD AND THE SPATIAL ABILITIES USED IN MATHEMATICS CLASSROOMS IS FUNDAMENTALLY A REPRESENTATION PROBLEM: BECAUSE OF THE CONSTRAINTS OF DRAWING ON FLAT SURFACES, THREE-DIMENSIONAL FIGURES ARE COMPRESSED INTO FLAT DIAGRAMS. BUT THE EMERGENCE OF EXTENDED REALITY (XR) TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS VIRTUAL AND AUGMENTED REALITY, OFFERS A PROFOUND SHIFT IN OUR CAPACITIES FOR REPRESENTING AND INTERACTING WITH INFORMATION. THREE-DIMENSIONAL FIGURES CAN NOW BE REPRESENTED AS DIAGRAMS THAT APPEAR TO EXTEND INTO SPACE IN WAYS THAT ARE FREE OF MATERIAL OR PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS. THEY CAN BE RENDERED AT ANY SIZE, IN ANY ORIENTATION, AND AT ANY POSITION IN SPACE, AND CAN THEREBY REALIZE A FAR MORE VARIED SET OF MATHEMATICAL CONCEPTS THAN WHAT IS POSSIBLE WITH PHYSICAL MODELS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO INVESTIGATE THE TRANSFORMATIVE EDUCATIONAL POTENTIAL OF THESE REPRESENTATIONS AND TO GENERATE A KNOWLEDGE BASE THAT TEACHERS, TEACHER EDUCATORS, AND RESEARCHERS CAN USE TO REIMAGINE THE LEARNING AND TEACHING OF GEOMETRY. THE EDUCATIONAL POTENTIAL OF SPATIAL INSCRIPTIONS WILL BE EXPLORED THROUGH TWO PARALLEL STRANDS OF RESEARCH. A TEACHING STRAND WILL CHARACTERIZE THE EXISTING REPRESENTATIONS FOR THREE-DIMENSIONAL FIGURES AND ANALYZE HOW THOSE REPRESENTATIONS FEATURE IN THE INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICES OF HIGH SCHOOL GEOMETRY TEACHERS. THE TEACHING STRAND HAS TWO COMPONENTS. (1) A SEMIOTIC AND CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS OF CONTEMPORARY HIGH SCHOOL GEOMETRY TEXTBOOKS WILL INVESTIGATE HOW THREE-DIMENSIONAL FIGURES ARE TYPICALLY REPRESENTED. (2) A SEMIOTIC ANALYSIS OF THE WORDS, SYMBOLS, DIAGRAMS, AND MODELS THAT HIGH SCHOOL GEOMETRY TEACHERS USE TO COMMUNICATE ABOUT THREE-DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRIC FIGURES WILL INVESTIGATE HOW THREE-DIMENSIONAL FIGURES ARE TYPICALLY REPRESENTED IN CLASSROOMS. A COMPLEMENTARY LEARNING STRAND OF RESEARCH WILL INVESTIGATE HOW THE UNIQUE AFFORDANCES OF DIAGRAMS INSCRIBED IN IMMERSIVE SPACES CAN BE LEVERAGED TO CREATE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TO EXPLORE THREE-DIMENSIONAL FIGURES. THE METHODS FOR THESE INVESTIGATIONS WILL BE TEXTBOOK ANALYSIS, CLASSROOM OBSERVATIONS, SURVEY EXPERIMENTS, AND TASK-BASED INTERVIEWS OF STUDENTS IN IMMERSIVE ENVIRONMENTS. THROUGH THE LEARNING STRAND OF RESEARCH, MULTIMODAL ANALYSES OF STUDENT EXPLORATIONS OF DIAGRAMS WILL GENERATE A FIRST APPROXIMATION OF A THEORY THAT EXPLAINS HOW MOVEMENT-BASED INTERACTIONS WITH SPATIALLY-INSCRIBED DIAGRAMS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE LEARNING AND TEACHING OF HIGH SCHOOL GEOMETRY. THROUGH THE TEACHING STRAND OF RESEARCH, ANALYSES OF THE EXTANT REPRESENTATIONS OF THREE-DIMENSIONAL FIGURES IN TEXTBOOKS AND HIGH SCHOOL GEOMETRY CLASSROOMS WILL PROVIDE A FOUNDATION FOR EMBEDDING THE EMERGING REPRESENTATIONS OF SPATIAL INSCRIPTIONS IN INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICES.

THE PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON CYBERSECURITY ISSUES IN REGULAR EXPRESSIONS. REGULAR EXPRESSIONS ARE AN IMPORTANT TOOL USED BY COMPUTER PROGRAMMERS TO MANIPULATE DATA. REGULAR EXPRESSIONS ARE APPLIED IN MANY WAYS, INCLUDING TO VALIDATE INPUT IN A WEB FORM AND TO CHECK INTERNET TRAFFIC FOR MALICIOUS ACTIVITY. UNFORTUNATELY, COMPUTER PROGRAMMERS OFTEN USE REGULAR EXPRESSIONS INCORRECTLY, LEADING TO INSECURE PROGRAM BEHAVIOR. THESE BEHAVIORS RESULT IN ERRORS WITH SERIOUS CYBERSECURITY CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING ALLOWING MALICIOUS ACTORS TO STEAL PERSONAL INFORMATION, SEIZE CONTROL OF A COMPUTER, OR CAUSE MANY WEBSITES TO CRASH. THIS PROJECT WILL ADDRESS THESE LIMITATIONS BY IMPROVING REGULAR EXPRESSION ENGINEERING PRACTICES, AND BY AND MAKING MORE TRUSTWORTHY THE INFRASTRUCTURE ON WHICH REGULAR EXPRESSIONS RELY. THE TEAM WILL INCORPORATE UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCHERS, DEVELOP EDUCATIONAL MATERIAL, AND ENGAGE WITH K-12 STUDENTS. THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE PROJECT WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT STEP TOWARDS ELIMINATING CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS RELATED TO REGULAR EXPRESSIONS. THIS PROJECT WILL DESIGN, DEVELOP, AND EVALUATE (PART 1) NEW TECHNIQUES TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR PROGRAMMERS TO RE-USE HIGH-QUALITY REGULAR EXPRESSIONS; AND (PART 2) NOVEL REGEX ENGINES THAT ARE SAFE FROM REGULAR EXPRESSION DENIAL OF SERVICE (REDOS). IN PART ONE, THE TEAM PROPOSES PROCESSES AND TOOLS TO HELP ENGINEERS DEVELOP CORRECT REGEXES. THE APPROACH IS GROUNDED IN THE RE-USE PARADIGM, HELPING ENGINEERS LEARN FROM OTHERS' EXPERTISE. HOWEVER, TO ENABLE RE-USE, OPEN PROBLEMS MUST BE ADDRESSED IN REGEX INDEXING, QUERYING, MATCHING, RANKING, AND COMPARISON.

THE RECENT ADVENT OF AUTONOMOUS CARS, DRONES AND INTERNET-OF-THINGS (IOT) FURTHER EXPANDS THE REACH OF THESE REAL-TIME SYSTEMS. THE LIMITATIONS OF SUCH DEVICES VIZ., SMALL COMPUTING POWER, LESS MEMORY, LIMITED BATTERY POWER, HAS SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR SECURITY, SPECIFICALLY, THEY BECOME MUCH HARDER TO PROTECT AND DEFEND. THIS RESEARCH DEVELOPS SYSTEMATIC SECURITY MECHANISMS FOR REAL-TIME EMBEDDED SYSTEMS IN CRITICAL APPLICATIONS TO CONTROL WHAT CAN BE OBSERVED ABOUT THEM. AN IMPORTANT REASON WHY REAL-TIME SYSTEMS ARE VULNERABLE IS THE FACT THAT THEY ARE PREDICTABLE BY DESIGN, THUS LEAKING CRITICAL INFORMATION. LEAKAGE, SAY VIA TIMING SIDE CHANNELS, MIGHT BE MISUSED AS PART OF A CAMPAIGN TO DISRUPT NORMAL OPERATIONS BY KNOWING THE SCHEDULE OF WHEN CRITICAL APPLICATIONS WILL RUN. ANY MITIGATIONS TO INFORMATION LEAKAGE MUST STILL ALLOW REAL-TIME SYSTEMS TO OPERATE WITHIN THEIR REQUIRED TIMING CONSTRAINTS. THIS PROJECT IMPROVES THE SECURITY OF REAL-TIME SYSTEMS USING CONCEPTS INSPIRED FROM THE AREA OF DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY THAT WAS DEVELOPED FOR DATABASE SECURITY, WHERE THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT IS TO HIDE PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION FROM QUERIES ON LARGE DATABASES BY INJECTING NOISE IN A SYSTEMATIC MANNER. BY ANALOGY FOR REAL-TIME SYSTEMS, THIS PROJECT FOCUSES ON SYSTEM STATES AT RUNTIME AND DEVELOPS THE NOTION OF SCHEDULE INDISTINGUISHABILITY BY STRATEGICALLY ADDING NOISE TO THE TASK SCHEDULER, SO INDIVIDUAL TASKS CANNOT BE DISTINGUISHED SEPARATELY AND CANNOT BE KNOWN. THE CONCEPT OF EPSILON-INDISTINGUISHABILITY IS DEVELOPED TO MEASURE THE PROBABILITY OF INFORMATION LEAKAGE OF SCHEDULE AND TIMING INFORMATION BY OBSERVATION OF TASK-LEVEL BEHAVIORS. A TASK SCHEDULER THAT EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY USES INDISTINGUISHABILITY IS DESIGNED AND PROTOTYPED. IN ADDITION, THE PROJECT FOCUSES ON DEVELOPING METRICS FOR REAL-TIME SYSTEMS TO MEASURE AND ASSESS THE RISK MITIGATIONS OF USING SCHEDULE INDISTINGUISHABILITY. THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO EXPLORE THE RELATIONSHIPS OF INDISTINGUISHABILITY FOR CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS AND THEIR APPLICATION DOMAINS WITH REGARD TO SECURITY, SAFETY, DEPENDABILITY, AND RESILIENCE.

GETTING A COMPREHENSIVE ANSWER TO A MEDICAL QUESTION FROM WEB SEARCH ENGINES CAN BE TIME-CONSUMING BECAUSE HEALTH INFORMATION, AS IS COMMON ON THE WEB, IS SCATTERED ACROSS MANY WEBSITES. ONE DIFFICULTY IS THE PREVALENT VOCABULARY MISMATCH BETWEEN DIFFERENT SOURCES DUE TO SYNONYMOUS WORDS, MORPHOLOGICAL VARIATIONS, ABBREVIATIONS, AND DIFFERENT WORD ORDERINGS. ANOTHER CHALLENGE IS THAT, FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT MEDICAL EXPERTS, HEALTH INFORMATION CAN BE COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT TO COMPREHEND. SUPPORTIVE VISUAL REPRESENTATIONS CAN BE HELPFUL TO VARIOUS PEOPLE, FOR EXAMPLE, THOSE READING TEXT NOT IN THEIR FIRST LANGUAGE, OLDER ADULTS, OR MORE GENERALLY, NON-EXPERTS. TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, THIS PROJECT BRINGS TOGETHER HEALTH INFORMATION IN A SINGLE UNIFIED PLACE BY ASSIMILATING, SYNTHESIZING, AND STORING HEALTH INFORMATION IN A BROAD-COVERAGE RESOURCE WITH A SHARED VOCABULARY. SUCH A RESOURCE SERVES THE PURPOSE OF FACILITATING FAST ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE ANSWERS TO HEALTH QUESTIONS TO SAVE PEOPLE TIME WHO OTHERWISE MIGHT NEED TO SPEND A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF TIME READING DIFFERENT SOURCES TO CONNECT THE DOTS AND GET A COMPLETE ANSWER TO THEIR INFORMATION NEED. TO HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND COMPLEX HEALTH INFORMATION, THE PROJECT WILL GENERATE SUMMARIES THAT COMBINE TEXT AND SUPPORTIVE VISUALIZATIONS. THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP NOVEL TECHNIQUES FOR INTEGRATING INFORMATION FROM DISPARATE SOURCES. THIS ENTAILS IDENTIFYING RELEVANT CONTENT AND RECONCILING THE MISMATCH IN THE VOCABULARIES OF DIFFERENT SOURCES. TO ENFORCE A SHARED VOCABULARY ACROSS SOURCES, THE PROJECT WILL DEVELOP NOVEL TECHNIQUES FOR ENTITY LINKING, THAT ARE NOT LIMITED TO RECOGNIZING ENTITIES SEEN AT TRAINING TIME, AS NEW DISEASES, TREATMENTS, OTHER TYPES OF MEDICAL ENTITIES CAN EMERGE.

THIS INSECT-BASED TREATMENT PROCESS CAN HELP WASTE MANAGERS TO ADDRESS EMERGING CONTAMINANTS OF CONCERN THAT WOULD CONVENTIONALLY REQUIRE COSTLY TREATMENT ADDITIONS AND/OR RENOVATIONS TO MEET UPCOMING REGULATORY STANDARDS. PROCESSING RECOVERED PRODUCTS FROM INSECT BIOMASS CAN MINERALIZE BIOACCUMULATIVE AND PERSISTENT CHEMICALS, E.G., DIESEL ENGINE COMBUSTION BYPRODUCTS. THIS METHOD OF ORGANIC WASTE TREATMENT CAN BE INTEGRATED INTO MAINSTREAM WASTE TREATMENT TRAINS. WHILE THERE ARE DIRECT PUBLIC BENEFITS, SUCH AS REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, THIS TECHNOLOGY MAY ALSO BE USED TO TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF USING DERIVED INSECT LIPIDS AS AN ALTERNATIVE BIOFUEL SOURCE, RESULTING IN ECONOMIC BENEFITS. THIS I-CORPS PROJECT IS BASED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGY TO CHANGE THE WAY ORGANIC WASTE IS MANAGED BY STREAMLINING BIOLOGICAL TREATMENT FOR DECONTAMINATION AND BYPRODUCT RECOVERY. THE TREATMENT TRAIN UTILIZES THE QUANTITATIVE STRUCTURE ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIP (QSAR) MODEL AND NONTARGET/SUSPECT-SCREENING ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES TO IDENTIFY CONTAMINANT PROFILES WHILE EMPLOYING INSECTS TO REDUCE ORGANIC WASTE, RECOVER NUTRIENTS (E.G., PROTEIN FRACTIONS), AND SEQUESTER ORGANIC CONTAMINANTS. POST PRODUCTION TREATMENT FOR INSECT TISSUE ENSURES DOWNSTREAM PRODUCTION OF HIGH-QUALITY PROTEIN FEED AND RENEWABLE BIODIESEL. THIS APPROACH IN LOW-COST WASTE REDUCTION UTILIZES INSECT LARVAE TO EFFICIENTLY PROCESS ORGANIC WASTE BY FEEDING ON IT AS A SUBSTRATE.

DECADES OF RESEARCH TO IMPROVE THE PREVENTION AND EARLY DETECTION OF SUICIDE RISK HAS LARGELY RESULTED IN THE DETECTION OF WHO IS MOST LIKELY TO CONSIDER SUICIDE, BUT NOT WHEN OR IF THAT IS MOST LIKELY TO HAPPEN. MOST DETECTION METHODS PRESUME PATIENTS ARE IN CONTACT WITH THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM, WHICH ONLY REACHES A PROPORTION OF THE AT-RISK POPULATION. MANY PEOPLE AT HIGH RISK FOR SUICIDE DO NOT SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP BECAUSE OF LACK OF TIME, STIGMA, AND FEAR REGARDING HOW THEY WILL BE TREATED IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE DEVELOP METHODS THAT CAN IDENTIFY PROXIMAL RISK FOR SUICIDE THAT DOES NOT DEPEND ON SYSTEM- LEVEL CONTACT. WEB-BASED SEARCH TOOLS ARE UBIQUITOUS, WITH 46% OF THE GLOBAL POPULATION USING THE INTERNET FOR INFORMATION SEARCHES AND 1.2 TRILLION SEARCHES PER YEAR WORLDWIDE. BASED ON OUR PRELIMINARY DATA, WE PROPOSE THAT THIS ONLINE SEARCH-ENGINE BEHAVIOR MAY PROVE TO BE AN EFFECTIVE, PRIVATE, AND IMMEDIATE METHOD OF PROXIMAL RISK DETECTION OF SUICIDE FOR ANYONE, REGARDLESS OF THEIR CONTACT WITH SYSTEMS OF CARE. WE WILL RECRUIT 1,000 PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS WITH VARYING RISK FOR SUICIDE. PARTICIPANTS WILL PROVIDE US ACCESS TO GOOGLE TAKE-OUT (GTO) DATA, WHICH INCLUDES SEARCH-ENGINE HISTORY AND BEHAVIOR INCLUDING YOUTUBE. PARTICIPANTS WILL INCLUDE THOSE WHO HAVE REPORT A SUICIDE ATTEMPT IN THE PAST YEAR (N=500), THOSE WHO HAVE MADE AN ATTEMPT OVER A YEAR AGO (N=250), AND THOSE WHO HAVE THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE BUT NEVER ATTEMPTED (N=250). ALL WILL PARTICIPATE USING GOLD-STANDARD SUICIDE BEHAVIOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTS. USING A CASE-CROSSOVER DESIGN, WE WILL EVALUATE THE INTERMITTENT EXPOSURES (SEARCH BASED PROXIMAL RISK FACTORS) WITH AN IMMEDIATE AND TRANSIENT EFFECT ON RISK AND AN ABRUPT OUTCOME (SUICIDE ATTEMPT). THE CASE-CROSSOVER DESIGN IS A WELL-TESTED AND PROVEN APPROACH ESPECIALLY IN CASES WHERE TRANSIENT EVENTS CAN TRIGGER ACUTE EVENTS SUCH AS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS, INJURIES, AND DEATH DUE TO ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES AND HAS BEEN STUDIED WITH INTERVIEW DATA TO DETERMINE WARNING SIGNS FOR SUICIDE ATTEMPTS. FURTHER FOR PREDICTING SUICIDAL ATTEMPT/S, WE WILL USE ROBUST ENSEMBLE-BASED MACHINE LEARNING METHODS SUCH AS RANDOM FOREST, GRADIENT BOOSTING TO EVALUATE THE PREDICTIVE NATURE OF QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE FEATURES. THE STUDY WILL CONCLUDE IN A COLLABORATIVE DISSEMINATION PLANNING PROCESS WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS.

IN 2018, THE STAKEHOLDER PREPAREDNESS REVIEW (SPR) FOUND THAT 50% OF STATES AND TERRITORIES IDENTIFIED CHEMICAL AND RADIOLOGICAL HAZARDOUS MATERIAL RELEASES, THE MOST FREQUENTLY CITED ‘TECHNOLOGICAL HAZARD’ WAS A TROUBLING CONCERN (FEMA, 2019). IN 2019, THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION REPORTED AN ALL-TIME HIGH 22,756 HAZARDOUS MATERIAL INCIDENTS, A 53% INCREASE FROM JUST 10 YEARS PRIOR (U.S. DOT, 2020). YET, FIRST RESPONDER HAZMAT TRAINING INITIATIVES FOR RESPONSE EFFORTS STILL OFTEN DO NOT ADEQUATELY PREPARE RESPONDERS TO SAFELY MANAGE A HAZMAT SCENE. CURRENT TRAININGS ARE LIMITED TO CLASSROOM-BASED TABLE TOP EXERCISES AND VIDEOS - WHICH DO NOT SUFFICIENTLY ILLUSTRATE THE RISK AND RESPONSE EFFORT. THERE IS A REAL NEED FOR EFFECTIVE HIGH-QUALITY, REALISTIC, AND RISK-BASED TRAINING TO PREPARE FIRST RESPONDERS TO ACT QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY WHEN FACED WITH A HAZARDOUS MATERIAL INCIDENT. THE TEAM HEADED BY METAMEDIA WILL WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE IAFF TO DEVELOP A MOBILE LEARNING GAMIFICATION APPLICATION COMBINING 360-DEGREE VR INTERFACED WITH OUR NEW LEARNING PARADIGM “POINT-OF-VIEW LEARNING” (PVL) AND GAMIFICATION TRAINING THAT IS GROUNDED IN THE ASSESS, PLAN, IMPLEMENT, AND EVALUATE (APIE) APPROACH, A PROVEN-EFFECTIVE RESPONSE PROCESS FOR HAZARDOUS MATERIAL SITUATIONS. OUR PROTOTYPE, ENGINE COMPANY 1 (EC1), CREATES A LIFELIKE EMERGENCY RESPONSE TRAINING ENVIRONMENT USING PVL THAT EMPLOYS A COLLABORATIVE, INTEGRATED SOLUTION COMBINING THE BEST OF KEY LEARNING METHODS INCLUDING: (1) INSTRUCTOR-LED TRAINING (ILT) AIDED BY A CUSTOM-DEVELOPED FACILITATOR’S GUIDE, (2) A REAL-WORLD VR SCENARIO, (3) A GAMIFICATION ELEARNING PLATFORM DESIGNED TO DISSEMINATE, DISPLAY, AND SCORE APIE-BASED CHALLENGE QUESTIONS, (4) AND A POST-ASSESSMENT IDENTIFYING WEAKNESSES AND FEEDBACK FOR REMEDIATION.

MAKING THE RIGHT DECISIONS IN AN EMERGENCY IS NOT ALWAYS STRAIGHTFORWARD AND MANY CAN INVOLVE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AND CHOICES TO PROPERLY AND SAFELY HANDLE THE SITUATION. THE NEED TO PROACTIVELY AND INNOVATIVELY SUPPORT AWARENESS AND PROBLEM-SOLVING SKILLS BEFORE FACING REAL-LIFE SITUATIONS IS CRITICAL. A 360- DEGREE VR SCENARIO COMBINED WITH GAMIFICATION THAT ENCOURAGES CALCULATED AND PLANNED THINKING FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES STRENGTHENS DECISION MAKING SKILLS, PUTS KNOWLEDGE INTO PRACTICE, MAKES RELEVANT TRAINING FUN AND COMPETITIVE, LETS THE LEARNER MAKE MISTAKES WITHOUT SUSTAINING HARM, AND PROVIDES A REMEDIATED ASSESSMENT FEEDBACK LOOP.

BSDA WILL PROVIDE $1024096 FROM SALES TAX REVENUE AS LOCAL MATCH FOR A TOTAL AMENDMENT 3 PROJECT COST OF $6024096.SGR FUNDS IN THIS APPLICATION SUPPORT TWO PROJECT ACTIVITIES: THE REPLACEMENT OF UP TO 9 40-FOOT BUSES (WITH 35-FOOTERS) FOR FIXED-ROUTE SERVICE IN THE MISSOURI PORTION OF METROS SERVICE AREA AND THE REPLACEMENT OF UP TO 13 VANS TO PROVIDE PARATRANSIT SERVICE IN THE MISSOURI PORTION OF METROS SERVICE AREA. ALL VEHICLES BEING REPLACED WILL HAVE MET THE FTA PRESCRIBED USEFUL LIFE REQUIREMENTS AT THE TIME OF REPLACEMENT. FURTHERMORE THEY DO NOT MEET THE FY2010 EPA EMISSIONS STANDARDS FOR HEAVY DUTY ENGINES. AS A RESULT THE OLDER VEHICLES RELEASE MORE POLLUTANTS INTO THE AIR THAN NEWLY MANUFACTURED BUSES AND VANS. REPLACEMENT VEHICLES WILL BE MANUFACTURED TO MEET THE 2010 OR LATER EPA EMISSIONS STANDARDS OF .20 NOX AND .014 PARTICULATE FOR DIESEL ENGINES. SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE REPLACEMENT VEHICLES WILL INCLUDE MINI-HYBRID FAN SYSTEMS; THESE SYSTEMS REDUCE ENGINE LOADS RESULTING IN REDUCED EMISSIONS FROM THE INCREASE IN FUEL MILEAGE.THE BI-STATE ST. LOUIS REGIONAL ITS ARCHITECTURE PLAN PROVIDES FOR ITS ACTIVITIES BEING UNDERTAKEN IN THIS AMENDMENT AS INDICATED WITH THE NON-ADD SCOPE INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET.SES 3/27/13 IN AMENDMENT 2 BI-STATE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY D/B/A METRO IS REVISING THE PROJECT BUDGET BETWEEN ALI 11.12.02 AND ALI 11.12.03 BOTH IN SCOPE 111-00 WHICH INCREASES THE NUMBER OF BUSES BEING PURCHASED IN ALI 11.12.02 TO 9 AND REDUCES THE NUMBER OF BUSES BEING PURCHASED IN ALI 11.12.03 TO ZERO. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF BUSES BEING PURCHASED IN SCOPE 111-00 REMAINS UNCHANGED AT 9. IN OUR INITIAL APPLICATION METRO INDICATED THAT THIRTY FOOT BUSES ELIGIBLE FOR REPLACEMENT WOULD BE REPLACED WITH EITHER THIRTY OR THIRTY-FIVE FOOT BUSES AS DETERMINED APPROPRIATE BY ROUTE ASSIGNMENT. AFTER A CAREFUL ANALYSIS OF THE CURRENT BUS ROUTES METRO HAS DETERMINED THAT ALL BUSES CURRENTLY BEING REPLACED USING FY11 STATE OF GOOD REPAIR FUNDING WILL BE REPLACED WITH 35-FOOTERS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH FTA C 5010.1D THIS CHANGE TRIGGERS AN AMENDMENT BECAUSE FUNDS OF $1324444 - FEDERAL $1595716 MOVING BETWEEN TWO ALIS EXCEEDS THE 20% THRESHOLD FOR BUDGET REVISIONS. ADDITIONALLY THIS AMENDMENT CHANGES THE NUMBER OF REVENUE ROLLING STOCK VEHICLES BY MORE THAN 20%; OUT OF A TOTAL OF 9 BUSES TO BE PURCHASED 4 ARE MOVING FROM ALI 11.12.03 TO 11.12.02.

THE COUPLING OF ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING AND LIQUID FUEL PROPULSION SYSTEMS IS THE NEXT GREAT ADVANCEMENT FOR SPACE TECHNOLOGY AND WILL ENSURE THAT SPACEFLIGHT REMAINS SAFE  AFFORDABLE  AND SUSTAINABLE FOR OUR NATION. IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT A 3D PRINTED TORCH IGNITER WOULD ACT AS A SUITABLE REPLACEMENT FOR TORCH IGNITERS MACHINED OUT OF WROUGHT METAL STOCK. 3D PRINTED INJECTORS AND THRUSTERS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN BUILT BY NASA AND UNDERGONE TESTING  BUT TO DATE  THEY HAVE EITHER BEEN IGNITED WITH A HYPERGOLIC PROPELLANT OR A TRADITIONALLY-MACHINED TORCH IGNITER. AN ADDITIVELY MANUFACTURED IGNITER COULD BE PRINTED DIRECTLY INTO THE INJECTOR SYSTEM  FURTHER REDUCING THE PART QUANTITY AND COMPLEXITY. VALIDATION OF A PRINTED DEVICE PROVIDES A LOW-COST  QUICKLYMANUFACTURED DEVICE USING STATE-OF-THE-ART MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES WITHOUT DIMINISHING OVERALL ENGINE PERFORMANCE. EXPLICITLY  THE ABILITY TO ADDITIVELY MANUFACTURE THE IGNITER REDUCES PART COUNTS  MANUFACTURING TIME  AND WELD JOINTS. THE PART AND WELDING REDUCTION WOULD INHERENTLY RAISE DEVICE RELIABILITY. THIS IS CRITICAL FOR MAIN ENGINE IGNITION AND OFFERS THE ABILITY FOR MULTIPLE IGNITION EVENTS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS DIRECTLY ALIGNED WITH OBJECTIVES LISTED IN NASAS SPACE TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP FOR LIQUID PROPELLANTS  1.2 LIQUID ROCKET PROPULSION SYSTEMS. THE SUB-GOAL OF WHICH STATES  IMPROVE THE PRODUCTION AND MANUFACTURABILITY OF LARGE BOOSTER ENGINES TO REDUCE COST WITHOUT SACRIFICING PERFORMANCE OR RELIABILITY. A 3D PRINTED IGNITER WOULD BE APPLICABLE FOR LIQUID HYDROGEN AND LIQUID METHANE FUELS. CURRENTLY  LIQUID HYDROGEN IS USED FOR NASAS RS-25 AND J-2X ENGINES. HOWEVER  THERE HAS BEEN GROWING INTEREST IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF LIQUID METHANE SYSTEMS DUE TO IN-SITU RESOURCE UTILIZATION DURING SPACE FLIGHT. CONSEQUENTLY  CREATION OF AN ADDITIVELY MANUFACTURED IGNITER  CAPABLE OF HANDLING BOTH FUELS  IS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN A COMPETITIVE STANCE AND TO REDUCE RESEARCH REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT AN UPCOMING FUEL. COMBINING THE TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES OF MANUFACTURING AND LIQUID FUELS WILL OFFER BENEFITS BEYOND SPACEFLIGHT. AEROSPACE APPLICATIONS ALONE RANGE FROM SMALL IN-SPACE THRUSTERS TO TORCH IGNITERS USED IN CORE-STAGE ENGINES THAT HAVE THRUST CAPABILITIES SIMILAR TO THE SPACE SHUTTLE MAIN ENGINE. AUXILIARY USES FOR THIS TECHNOLOGY INCLUDES SCRAMJETS  GAS-TURBINES  AND OTHER TERRESTRIAL IGNITION NEEDS. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL ADDRESS BOTH CURRENT AND FUTURE NEEDS FOR RELIABLE IGNITION SYSTEMS IN TERRESTRIAL AND SPACE SYSTEMS.

THERE HAS BEEN INTENSE OBSERVATIONAL AND THEORETICAL RESEARCH IN RECENT YEARS  BUT RESEARCH IN THIS AREA HAS BEEN LARGELY FOCUSED ON STUDIES OF TIME HISTORIES  SPECTRA  AND SPATIAL DISTRIBUTIONS. THEORETICAL MODELS SHOW THAT A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE INNER STRUCTURE OF GRBS  INCLUDING THE GEOMETRY AND PHYSICAL PROCESSES CLOSE TO THE CENTRAL ENGINE  REQUIRES THE EXPLOITATION OF GAMMA-RAY POLARIMETRY. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS  WE HAVE DEVELOPED THE GRAPE INSTRUMENT TO MEASURE THE POLARIZATION OF GAMMA-RAYS FROM GRBS OVER THE ENERGY RANGE OF 50 TO 500 KEV. GRAPE IS A LARGE FOV INSTRUMENT WITH A SENSITIVE ENERGY RANGE COVERING THE PEAK ENERGY DISTRIBUTION OF GRBS. THE DESIGN IS BASED ON AN ARRAY OF INDEPENDENT MODULES  EACH OF WHICH CONSISTS OF AN ARRAY OF (HIGH-Z AND LOW-Z) SCINTILLATOR ELEMENTS READ OUT BY A MULTI-ANODE PMT (MAPMT). OUR EVENTUAL GOAL IS TO FLY GRAPE ON A LONG DURATION BALLOON (LDB) PLATFORM OR AN ORBITING PLATFORM TO COLLECT DATA ON A SIGNIFICANT SAMPLE OF GRBS  ALLOWING US TO PLACE CONSTRAINTS ON FUNDMENTAL GRB MODELS. OUR EXPERIENCE WITH TWO BALLOON FLIGHTS (IN 2011 AND 2014)  COUPLED WITH FURTHER DESIGN EFFORTS FOCUSED ON ORBITAL PAYLOADS  HAS LED TO AN IMPROVED POLARIMETER DESIGN. THE NEW DESIGN EMPLOYS A LARGE NUMBER OF OPTICALLY-ISOLATED SCINTILLATOR CUBES  WITH INDEPENDENT SILICON PHOTOMULTIPLIER READOUT  ARRANGED IN A THREE-DIMENSIONAL ARRAY. THE RESULTING THREE-DIMENSIONAL LOCATION DATA PROVIDES A MODERATE LEVEL OF COMPTON IMAGING CAPABILITY (1 SIGMA ANGULAR RESOLUTION OF 10-15 DEGREES). THE IMAGING CAN NOT ONLY BE USED TO DETERMINE THE GRB LOCATION (ALBEIT WITH LIMITED ACCURACY)  IT CAN ALSO BE USED TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE INSTRUMENTAL BACKGROUND BY LIMITING THE IMPACT OF THE COSMIC DIFFUSE FLUX  IMPROVING THE POLARIZATION SENSITIVITY. IT IS THE BACKGROUND REDUCTION THAT IS MOST IMPORTANT IN THIS CASE. WE HAVE ALREADY EVALUATED SOME COMPONENTS OF THIS DESIGN AND ARE NOW PREPARED TO EMBARK ON AN EFFORT TO FABRICATE A PROTOTYPE TO BE VALIDATED ON A HIGH ALTITUDE BALLOON FLIGHT.

AND DRUG PRODUCT SHELF LIFE (<=3 YRS.) REPRESENTS A MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR NASA S EVOLABLE MARS CAMPAIGN. THE CURRENT PRACTICE IS TO PREDICT AND STOCKPILE EVERY DRUG THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED DURING SPACE MISSIONS. ONE CAN THINK OF REFORMULATING DRUGS TO INCREASE THEIR SHELF LIFE UNTIL RE-SUPPLY IS LOGISTICALLY POSSIBLE  BUT AS MISSION DURATION IS EXPECTED TO EXTEND OVER PROGRESSIVELY LONGER PERIODS  OTHER ALTERNATIVES NEED TO BE EXPLORED. POINT-OF-USE DRUG MANUFACTURING IS ABLE TO RECONCILE THE NEED TO PRODUCE UNANTICIPATED DRUGS AND CIRCUMVENT SHELF LIFE ISSUES  WITH THE NEED TO SUSTAIN THE CREWS HEALTH AND INDEPENDENCE FROM EARTH S DRUG SUPPLY DURING LONG-TERM DEEP SPACE MISSIONS. YET  CURRENT PRACTICES IN PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURING (LARGE-SCALE) ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING NEEDS FOR SMALL PATIENT POPULATIONS (MISSION CREWS) AND THE LIMITED RESOURCES (TIME  SPACE  ENERGY  PERSONNEL) AVAILABLE IN SPACE. THE GOAL OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH PROGRAM IS TO DELIVER A PERSONALIZED MEDICATION SYSTEM FOR DEEP SPACE MISSIONS THAT WILL PRODUCE TWO MODEL DRUGS  NAPROXEN (DOSED<=1.5 G/DAY) AND WARFARIN (DOSED<=10 MGAY). THE RESEARCH WILL DEVELOP SEVERAL STATE-OF-THE-ART L TO ML-SCALE UNIT OPERATIONS FOR FLOW SYNTHESIS  PURIFICATION  FILTRATION  DRYING  AND FORMULATION USING PROCESS INTENSIFICATION (OBJECTIVE 1)  WHICH CAN BE INTEGRATED IN A PLUG-AND PLAY APPROACH TO ACCOMMODATE THE MANUFACTURING NEEDS OF THE MODEL DRUGS AND FUTURE TARGET DRUGS IN SPACE (OBJECTIVE 2). THE SOLID DOSAGE FORMULATIONS FOR BOTH ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENTS (APIS) DEMAND SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS IN TERMS OF PROCESS ANALYTICAL TECHNOLOGIES AND US PHARMACOPEIA TO TEST FOR PRODUCT COMPLIANCE (YIELD  PURITY  SOLID-FORM  DOSE  STABILITY)  WHICH WILL BE TESTED IN OBJECTIVE 3. THE MODEL APIS WERE SELECTED TO DEMONSTRATE THE SYSTEM S CAPABILITY TO PRODUCE A WIDE RANGE OF DOSES AS THE REQUIRED DAILY DOSE OF THE DRUGS VARIES (MG TO G/DAY). PARTICULARLY  THE PRODUCTION OF FLEXIBLE DOSES FOR WARFARIN  THE MOST COMMONLY PRESCRIBED ORAL ANTICOAGULANT AND POSTER CHILD OF PERSONALIZED MEDICATION WILL DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY TO REDUCE RISKS FOR DRUG-RELATED ADVERSE EVENTS (OBJECTIVE 3). HUMAN SPACE FLIGHTS REPRESENT A SCENARIO WHERE THERAPY FAILURE OR ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS NEED TO BE PREVENTED AT ALL COSTS. A RECENT STUDY INDICATED THAT ~30% OF THE DRUGS AVAILABLE ON THE ISS NEED INDIVIDUAL DOSE ADJUSTMENTS. IN THE LONG TERM  THE SCIENCE ADVANCED BY THIS PROOF-OF-CONCEPT SYSTEM COULD BE EMPLOYED TO MANUFACTURE ADDITIONAL DRUGS OF NASA S INTEREST (E.G. AMOXICILLIN  CETIRIZINE  PROMETHAZINE  ZALEPLON). THE SYSTEM WOULD ALSO ALLOW THE CREW TO REPROCESS STOCKPILED AND PARTIALLY DEGRADED APIS WITHIN ITS PURIFICATION AND FORMULATION CAPABILITIES  AND THUS  WILL CONTRIBUTE TO IN SITU RESOURCE UTILIZATION (ISRU) IN SPACE. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH BRINGS TOGETHER PAST EFFORTS IN SMALL-SCALE (ML-SCALE) CRYSTALLIZATION AND PHARMACOGENETIC ANALYSIS OF WARFARIN FOR THE FORMULATION OF PERSONALIZED MEDICATION AT THE POINT-OF-USE. ULTIMATELY  THE REALIZATION OF THE OBJECTIVES WILL ESTABLISH A PROGRAM THAT STIMULATES COMPETITIVE RESEARCH AND STRONG PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN THE JURISDICTION AND NASA IN TECHNOLOGY AREAS THAT SPAN ACROSS MULTIPLE NASA TECHNOLOGY AREAS (TA 6&12). THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS POISED TO IMPROVE CURRENT PRACTICES IN PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURING RESULTING IN OVERALL BENEFITS FOR THE GENERAL US POPULATION (PERSONALIZED MEDICATION  ORPHAN DRUGS  CANCER  HIV/ AIDS  CLINICAL TRIALS  CUSTOMIZED FIXED-DOSE COMBINATIONS)  WHICH REPRESENTS THE BROADER VISION OF NASA S TECHNOLOGY ROADMAPS.

HOWEVER, THIS APPROACH IS LIMITED BY AVAILABLE MATERIALS THAT CAN WITHSTAND THESE EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS. IN THIS DESIGNING MATERIALS TO REVOLUTIONIZE AND ENGINEER OUR FUTURE (DMREF) PROJECT, THE DISCOVERY OF NEW MATERIALS THAT ENABLE HIGHER TEMPERATURE TURBINE OPERATION WILL BE ACCELERATED THROUGH COMPUTATIONAL METHODS THAT ARE VALIDATED WITH EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS. MATERIALS TO BE STUDIED INCLUDE MIXED RARE EARTH SILICATES FOR POTENTIAL HIGH TEMPERATURE COATINGS OF TURBINE ENGINE COMPONENTS. COATINGS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT USE A SINGLE RARE EARTH ELEMENT IN THE SILICATE. MIXING VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF THE FIFTEEN RARE EARTH ELEMENTS IN THE SILICATES PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES TO DISCOVER AND OPTIMIZE DESIRABLE COATING PROPERTIES, INCLUDING LOW THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY AND HIGH STABILITY IN THE REACTIVE TURBINE ENGINE ENVIRONMENTS. HIGH THROUGHPUT COMPUTATIONAL APPROACHES WILL BE USED TO UNDERSTAND TRENDS IN MATERIAL PROPERTIES AS THE COMPOSITION IS VARIED. THE CONCEPT OF ACCELERATED MATERIAL DISCOVERY WILL BE TAUGHT TO THE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS INVOLVED IN THE PROJECT AND THE APPLICATION AND IMPORTANCE OF MATERIALS IN ENGINES WILL BE DEMONSTRATED TO ELEMENTARY STUDENTS THROUGH OUTREACH ACTIVITIES. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: THIS RESEARCH WILL ACCELERATE NEW UNDERSTANDING OF THE INTERPLAY OF CATION COMPLEXITY ON PHASE STABILITY OF HIGH ENTROPY RARE EARTH SILICATES IN EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS. THE COMPUTATION-EXPERIMENT-FEEDBACK LOOP COUPLED WITH MACHINE LEARNING AND HIGH THROUGHPUT COMPUTATION WILL RESULT IN HERETOFORE UNREALIZED LINKAGES OF ENTROPY-INDUCED MATERIAL STABILITY, THERMAL PROPERTIES, AND CORROSION RESISTANCE. THE PROJECT WILL RESULT IN ADVANCES IN FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING AND DISCOVERY OF NOVEL MATERIALS THAT CAN BE DESIGNED FOR SPECIFIC EXTREME ENVIRONMENT APPLICATIONS. THE COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH TO MATERIALS DISCOVERY WILL UTILIZE AFLOW: HIGH THROUGHPUT PROPERTY PREDICTION. THESE PREDICTIONS WILL BE TESTED BY CHARACTERIZING RARE EARTH SILICATES SYNTHESIZED VIA SOLID STATE SINTERING, CHEMICAL TECHNIQUES FOR IMPROVED CATION MIXING, AND GAS PHASE PULSED LASER DEPOSITION OF THIN FILMS. PHASE STABILITY AND CHEMICAL DISORDER WILL BE CHARACTERIZED THROUGH USE OF TECHNIQUES INCLUDING X-RAY DIFFRACTION AND TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY. RESULTING STABILITY OF RARE EARTH SILICATE MIXTURES WILL INFORM IMPROVEMENTS IN THE COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH FOR MATERIALS DISCOVERY. ADDITIONALLY, COMPUTATIONAL APPROACHES WILL BE USED TO PREDICT PHONON TRANSPORT AND THERMAL PROPERTIES. THESE PREDICTED THERMAL PROPERTIES WILL BE COMPARED AGAINST THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY MEASUREMENTS AS A FUNCTION OF TEMPERATURE THROUGH USE OF TIME DOMAIN AND STEADY STATE THERMOREFLECTANCE, AND HOT DISK TECHNIQUES. ENVIRONMENTAL STABILITY WILL BE EXPERIMENTALLY CHARACTERIZED USING STEAM-JET TESTING, AN EXTREME ENVIRONMENT LABORATORY TEST CREATING HIGH-TEMPERATURE, HIGH-VELOCITY, REACTIVE STEAM REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMBUSTION ENVIRONMENT.

THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO PRODUCE A MODELING TOOL FOR GUIDING THE DESIGN AND OPTIMIZING THE OPERATION OF ELECTROSPRAY THRUSTERS. THE KEY INNOVATION IS THE INCLUSION  FOR THE FIRST TIME  OF NOVEL PHYSICS DRIVING THE OPERATION OF THE NANOMETRIC REGIME. IN PARTICULAR  THE MODEL WILL INCLUDE: A) THE EQUATIONS OF THE LEAKY DIELECTRIC MODEL (I.E. CONSERVATION OF MASS  MOMENTUM AND SURFACE CHARGE; LAPLACE EQUATION FOR THE ELECTROSTATIC POTENTIAL; AND THE YOUNG- LAPLACE EQUATION FOR THE POSITION OF THE FREE SURFACE); B) A NOVEL TERM IN THE CHARGE CONSERVATION EQUATION TO MODEL ION EVAPORATION; AND C) A NOVEL ENERGY CONSERVATION EQUATION TO REPRODUCE THE NON-HOMOGENEOUS TEMPERATURE FIELD CAUSED BY ENERGY DISSIPATION. PROPELLANT PROPERTIES WILL RETAIN THEIR DEPENDENCE ON TEMPERATURE. THE DIRECT OUTCOMES OF THE MODEL ARE THE DEPENDENCE OF THE BEAM CURRENT  ION/DROPLET CURRENT FRACTIONS  JET DIAMETER  DROPLET CHARGE TO MASS RATIO  AND PRESSURE JUMP ACROSS THE LIQUID SURFACE ON THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE PROPELLANT  THE FLOW RATE  THE GEOMETRY OF THE ELECTRODES AND THE EMITTER TEMPERATURE. MODEL RESULTS WILL BE VALIDATED WITH EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENTS OF RELEVANT ELECTROSPRAY CHARACTERISTICS. THE INTEREST IN SMALLSATS HAS EXPLODED IN THE LAST TWO DECADES DUE TO ADVANCEMENTS IN ELECTRONICS  POWER AND FABRICATION TECHNIQUES  COMBINED WITH THE SIGNIFICANT LOWER MISSION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FABRICATION AND LAUNCH OF THESE PLATFORMS AS SECONDARY PAYLOADS. HOWEVER  THE CURRENT ABSENCE OF ADVANCED MICROPROPULSION IS PREVENTING THE USE OF SMALLSATS IN MISSIONS OF HIGH VALUE TO NASA SUCH AS SPACECRAFT CONSTELLATIONS  FORMATION FLYING  INSERTION INTO HIGH ALTITUDE ORBITS  INTERPLANETARY VOYAGE  ETC. THE MINIMUM THRUST AND POWER AT WHICH ELECTROSPRAY PROPULSION CAN OPERATE  ITS HIGH EFFICIENCY  THE SMALL FOOTPRINT PER EMITTER  AND THE EASINESS FOR SCALE UP  MAKE ELECTROSPRAY PROPULSION A TECHNOLOGY IDEAL FOR PRIMARY PROPULSION AND ATTITUDE CONTROL OF CUBESATS AND LARGER SMALLSATS. CONVENTIONAL ELECTRIC PROPULSION TECHNOLOGIES BASED ON A PLASMA DISCHARGE (E.G. ION ENGINES AND HALL THRUSTERS)  ARE DIFFICULT TO MINIATURIZE BELOW POWER LEVELS OF TENS OF WATTS DUE TO INCREASING LOSSES AT DECREASING PLASMA DISCHARGE VOLUME  AND ARE LIKELY UNSUITABLE FOR THESE PLATFORMS WITH HIGHLY RESTRICTED VOLUME  MASS AND POWER BUDGETS. ELECTROSPRAY PROPULSION IS THUS AN ENABLING TECHNOLOGY FOR SMALLSATS  AND A FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE OF HOW IT OPERATES IS NEEDED TO FULFILL ITS POTENTIAL. UNDERSTANDING HOW TO INCREASE THE CHARGE TO MASS RATIO OF ELECTROSPRAYED DROPLETS WHILE SUPPRESSING ION EVAPORATION  AND THEREFORE DEVELOPING THE CAPABILITY TO INCREASE THE ISP  WILL BE A MAYOR IMPROVEMENT AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL DERIVED FROM THIS PROJECT. CURRENTLY  THE ISP OF ELECTROSPRAY THRUSTERS OPERATING IN THE DROPLET AND DROPLET/ION MIXED REGIME IS A FEW HUNDRED SECONDS  A RELATIVELY LOW VALUE THAT LIMITS ITS USE FOR HYPOTHETICAL SMALLSAT MISSIONS REQUIRING HIGH DELTA-V (E.G. INTERPLANETARY FLIGHT AND TRANSFER TO HIGH ALTITUDE ORBITS). A SECOND IMPROVEMENT WILL BE LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR A PASSIVE FEED SYSTEM IN WHICH THE PROPELLANT FLOWS THROUGH THE INNER CHANNEL OF A CAPILLARY TUBE TOWARDS THE EMITTER TIP  PULLED BY THE NEGATIVE PRESSURE IN THE TAYLOR CONE EXERTED BY THE ELECTRIC FIELD. A THIRD IMPROVEMENT IS OBTAINING A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF OPERATION AT VARYING EMITTER TEMPERATURE  A COMMON OCCURRENCE DUE TO THE CHANGING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS TYPICAL OF SPACE MISSIONS.,NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,H,PUBLIC/STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_NNX17AD01G_8000/,2021-09-20 19:22:51.560912+00

TODAY?S MAINSTREAM STATE-OF-THE-ART HIGH-TEMPERATURE SENSING SOLUTIONS INVOLVE MULTIPLE COMPONENTS DISTRIBUTED IN DISTANT ZONES AT VARIOUS TEMPERATURES AND CONNECTED VIA HIGH-TEMPERATURE CABLES OR FIBERS, RESULTING IN BULKY AND INEFFECTIVE SENSING SYSTEMS. MINIATURE HIGH-TEMPERATURE SENSORS ARE THUS HIGHLY DESIRABLE, TO PROVIDE REAL-TIME SENSING AND MONITORING CAPABILITIES IN SMALL FORM FACTOR, PARTICULARLY TOWARD FUTURE INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT) ADAPTABLE TO HARSH ENVIRONMENTS. TO DATE, INTEGRATED HIGH-TEMPERATURE (UP TO 1000?C) SENSORS REMAIN CHALLENGING DUE TO THE LACK OF DEVICE TECHNOLOGIES IN BOTH SENSING ELEMENTS AND INTERFACING CIRCUITS. IN ADDITION TO DEVELOPING A SUITABLE PLATFORM, FUNDAMENTAL STUDIES OF THE EFFECTS OF ~1000?C HIGH TEMPERATURE UPON DEVICES ARE GREATLY NEEDED. THIS PROJECT IS FOCUSED ON INNOVATING 1000?C-CAPABLE SENSORS BASED ON INTEGRATING GRAPHENE NANOELECTROMECHANICAL RESONATORS AND GRAPHENE ELECTRONICS, BY EXPLOITING THE INHERENT HIGH-TEMPERATURE DURABILITY AND UNIQUE COMBINATION OF THE ELECTRICAL, THERMAL, AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF GRAPHENE. THIS RESEARCH WILL LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR DEVELOPING ULTRACOMPACT, ULTRALOW-WEIGHT SENSORS THAT CAN OPERATE AT VERY HIGH TEMPERATURES AND IN HARSH ENVIRONMENTS, ESPECIALLY IN ENERGY AND AEROSPACE INDUSTRY, AND FOR ENVIRONMENT AND DISASTER MONITORING (E.G., TO ASSIST DRONES FOR FIGHTING WILDFIRES). FINDINGS IN THIS RESEARCH OF ATOMICALLY THIN CRYSTALS AND THEIR DEVICES WILL GENERATE FASCINATING EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING MATERIALS AND INSPIRATIONS FOR STUDENTS FROM K-12 THROUGH GRADUATE SCHOOL. THE PROJECT ALSO CREATES OPPORTUNITIES FOR BROADENING THE PARTICIPATION OF UNDERREPRESENTED AND ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGEOUS GROUPS, AND FOR PARTNERSHIP TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN ACADEMIA AND INDUSTRY IN SCALED MANUFACTURING. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO DESIGN, MODEL, FABRICATE, AND EXPERIMENTALLY DEMONSTRATE A NEW CLASS OF LOW-POWER RESONANT NANOELECTROMECHANICAL SENSORS FOR VERY HIGH OR EXTREME TEMPERATURE, AND HARSH-ENVIRONMENT APPLICATIONS WHERE TEMPERATURE OF INTEREST CAN EXCEED 1000?C. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL ACHIEVE THESE GOALS BY SYSTEMATICALLY INVESTIGATING ATOMICALLY THIN GRAPHENE TWO-DIMENSIONAL (2D) RESONANT NANOELECTROMECHANICAL TRANSDUCERS, 2D NANOELECTRONIC CIRCUITS, AND THEIR INTEGRATED SYSTEMS. BUILT ON UNDERSTANDING FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND LIMITATIONS IN STATE-OF-THE-ART DEVICES AND SYSTEMS, THIS PROJECT EXPLOITS MULTIPHYSICS COUPLING AMONG MECHANICAL, ELECTRICAL, AND THERMAL DOMAINS AT HIGH TEMPERATURE IN GRAPHENE RESONANT NANOELECTROMECHANICAL SYSTEMS (NEMS) PLATFORM, TO CARRY OUT EFFICIENT AND JUDICIOUS USE OF THE INTERNAL TRANSDUCTION EFFECTS THAT UNIQUELY EXIST IN HIGH-TEMPERATURE ENVIRONMENT, THANKS TO THE INHERENT HIGH-TEMPERATURE ENDURANCE OF GRAPHENE. SPECIFICALLY, THIS EAGER PROJECT WILL DEMONSTRATE GRAPHENE NEMS OSCILLATORS WITH REAL-TIME SENSING CAPABILITIES, BY CO-DESIGNING AND FABRICATING GRAPHENE NEMS AND GRAPHENE ELECTRONICS THAT ARE CHIP-TO-CHIP INTEGRATED USING HIGH-TEMPERATURE INTERCONNECTS. AFTER SUCCESSFUL CONSTRUCTION OF GRAPHENE OSCILLATORS, TEMPERATURE SENSING UP TO 1000?C OR EVEN HIGHER WILL BE DEMONSTRATED, TO VALIDATE SENSING FUNCTION OF THE GRAPHENE NEMS OSCILLATORS.

IT HAS BECOME CLEAR THAT PROVIDING ACCESS TO INFORMATION THROUGH NATURAL LANGUAGE CONVERSATIONS WILL PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE FUTURE OF SEARCH TECHNOLOGY. THIS WILL BE ENABLED BY DEVELOPING EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE CONVERSATIONAL SEARCH ENGINES. EXISTING SYSTEMS ARE GENERALLY DESIGNED BASED ON A QUERY-RESPONSE PARADIGM, IN WHICH THE USER INITIATES THE INTERACTION BY SUBMITTING TYPING A WORD OR PHRASE, AND THE SYSTEM RESPONDS WITH ONE OR MORE DOCUMENTS. THIS PROCESS REPEATS ITSELF UNTIL THE USER EITHER RECEIVES A USEFUL RESPONSE OR TERMINATES THE SEARCH SESSION. THIS IS NOT AN OPTIMAL DESIGN FOR INTERACTION. A BETTER APPROACH WOULD BE TO CREATE SEARCH SYSTEMS THAT OPERATE LIKE A CONVERSATION. IN A CONVERSATIONAL SEARCH SYSTEMS, FOR INSTANCE, THE SYSTEM MAY ASK A CLARIFYING QUESTION OR CAN RECOMMEND NEW INFORMATION EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT AN EXPLICIT RESPONSE TO THE SEARCH QUERY. A CONVERSATIONAL SEARCH SYSTEM, THE CONVERSATION SHOULD YIELD THE INFORMATION THAT IS NEEDED TO FACILITATE THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF USER SATISFACTION. THE MENTIONED QUERY-RESPONSE PARADIGM DOES NOT SUPPORT THESE NATURAL CONVERSATIONAL INTERACTIONS. THIS CAREER AWARD AIMS TO ADVANCE THE STATE-OF-THE-ART BY ENVISIONING SOLUTIONS THAT GO BEYOND THIS QUERY-RESPONSE PARADIGM. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, THIS PROJECT STUDIES THEORETICAL AND MACHINE LEARNING SOLUTIONS FOR GENERATING AND HANDLING MIXED-INITIATIVE INTERACTIONS IN INFORMATION SEEKING CONVERSATIONS. IN MORE DETAIL, THIS PROJECT EXPLORES THE FOLLOWING THREE RESEARCH THRUSTS: (1) DEVELOPING THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS FOR MEASURING MIXED-INITIATIVE INFORMATION SEEKING CONVERSATIONS; (2) DEVELOPING MODELS FOR CLARIFYING THE USER'S INFORMATION NEEDS WHICH IS CONSIDERED AS THE MOST COMMON MIXED-INITIATIVE INTERACTION TYPE; AND (3) DEVELOPING MODELS FOR PROACTIVE INFORMATIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO ONGOING CONVERSATIONS.

IN SOME MATERIALS THIS TRANSFORMATION IS REVERSIBLE, SO THAT THE MATERIAL CAN REPEATEDLY TRANSFORM BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN TWO SHAPES, GIVING RISE TO THE PROPERTY OF ?SHAPE MEMORY?. IN A MARTENSITIC CERAMIC LIKE ZIRCONIA, THE SHAPE CHANGE IS VERY LARGE (ELONGATING AND CONTRACTING A SHAPE BY ~10%) AND IT ALSO EXERTS VERY LARGE FORCES. FOR THIS REASON, SHAPE MEMORY MATERIALS ARE LIKE ?SOLID-STATE ENGINES?, ABLE TO DO WORK ON THEIR SURROUNDINGS AS ACTUATORS.

ADDITIONALLY, THE PROJECT WILL ALSO PROVIDE SCIENTIFIC TRAINING FOR TWO PHD STUDENTS, ONE AT EACH INSTITUTION, AND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES WILL INVOLVE A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT TO STRENGTHEN THE ROLL OUT OF A MATERIALS SCIENCE MINOR PROGRAM AT BYU TO UNIFY MATERIALS-ORIENTED STUDENTS THAT ARE SPREAD ACROSS DIFFERENT MAJORS ON CAMPUS. TECHNICAL SUMMARY SUPPORTED BY THE CERAMICS PROGRAM IN THE DIVISION OF MATERIALS RESEARCH, THIS PROJECT INVESTIGATES A NEW CLASS OF SHAPE MEMORY CERAMICS IN WHICH THE CLASSICAL ADVANTAGES OF SHAPE MEMORY (THE ABILITY TO DO LARGE AMOUNTS OF MECHANICAL WORK THROUGH A SOLID STATE PHASE TRANSFORMATION) ARE PAIRED WITH A NEW MECHANISM FOR ACTIVATING THAT PROPERTY (AN ELECTRIC FIELD-DRIVEN PARAELECTRIC-TO-PARAELECTRIC PHASE TRANSFORMATION). BESIDES DEVELOPING AN ENTIRELY NEW CLASS OF ?PARAELECTROACTIVE? CERAMICS THAT CAN PERFORM MEANINGFUL MECHANICAL WORK AND EXPANDING THE PORTFOLIO OF ELECTROACTIVE CERAMICS, THE RESEARCH ALSO HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE THEORY OF PHASE TRANSFORMATIONS MORE BROADLY. THE RESEARCH INVOLVES FOUR INTERRELATED TASKS: (1) DEVELOPING AND VALIDATING THERMODYNAMIC MODELS THAT INCORPORATE THE COUPLED INFLUENCE OF ELECTRICAL-THERMAL-MECHANICAL ENERGY ON A PARAELECTRIC-TO-PARAELECTRIC MARTENSITIC TRANSFORMATION; (2) EXAMINING THE ROLE OF CRYSTAL ORIENTATION AND ANISOTROPIC MATERIAL PROPERTIES ON THE PREDICTED AND OBSERVED PHASE TRANSFORMATION CONDITIONS; (3) EXPLORING THE ROLE OF DOPANTS TO CONTROL THE TRANSFORMATION CONDITIONS AND ENABLE ROOM TEMPERATURE OPERATION OF THIS PHENOMENON; (4) EXPANDING THE MATERIALS-SCOPE OF THE PHENOMENON BY DISCOVERING ALTERNATIVE (NON-ZIRCONIA) SHAPE MEMORY CERAMICS THAT EXHIBIT PARAELECTRIC-PARAELECTRIC MARTENSITIC TRANSFORMATIONS. THESE TASKS ARE COLLABORATIVELY INVESTIGATED WITH A PRIMARILY EXPERIMENTAL EFFORT IN PROF. SCHUH?S RESEARCH GROUP AT THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND PROF.

CURRENT TECHNOLOGY RELIES ON THE CAPILLARY FORCE WITHIN SCREENED CHANNELS OF A LIQUID ACQUISITION DEVICE (LAD) TO DELIVER VAPOR FREE CRYOGENIC LIQUID DURING ENGINE RESTART AND CRITICAL TRANSFER PROCESSES. HOWEVER  DUE TO THE LOW TEMPERATURES ASSOCIATED WITH CRYOGENIC FLUIDS  EXTERNAL HEATING ACTING ON THE TANK WHERE THIS FLUID IS STORED WILL CAUSE VAPOR BUBBLES TO FORM WITHIN THE LAD THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO REMOVE IN EXISTING DESIGNS. A MORE EFFICIENT DESIGN IS NEEDED TO RELIABLY REMOVE VAPOR BUBBLES WITHOUT COSTLY THRUSTING MANEUVERS OR ACTIVE SEPARATION SYSTEMS. A SMALL MODIFICATION TO A COMMONLY USED LAD IS PROPOSED: A TAPERED CHANNEL. THIS DESIGN PASSIVELY REMOVES OR PUMPS-OUT CRYOGENIC VAPOR BUBBLES THAT ARE INTERNALLY GENERATED  SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVING TRANSFER OR DELIVERY OF CRYOGENIC FLUIDS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO INCREASE THE TECHNOLOGY READINESS LEVEL (TRL) OF THIS TAPERED CHANNEL LAD DESIGN TO TRL 5 BY CHARACTERIZING ITS PERFORMANCE IN A RELEVANT ENVIRONMENT ABOARD A SUBORBITAL VEHICLE THAT CAN PROVIDE MULTIPLE MINUTES OF HIGH QUALITY MICROGRAVITY. THE TEST APPARATUS INCLUDES MULTIPLE TAPERED SCREEN CHANNELS FILLED WITH LIQUID AND A VAPOR BUBBLE. A CAMERA WILL RECORD VAPOR BUBBLE MIGRATION ACROSS EACH CHANNEL IN ALL PHASES OF FLIGHT. IMAGE ANALYSIS WILL GIVE BUBBLE GEOMETRY  VELOCITY  AND TRAVEL DISTANCE  SHOWING HOW INTERNALLY GENERATED VAPOR BUBBLES ARE PASSIVELY REMOVED IN THE TAPERED SCREEN CHANNEL LAD. THIS EXPERIMENT WILL PROVIDE NOVEL DATA THAT WILL DIRECTLY BENEFIT NASA IN-SPACE PROPULSION TECHNOLOGY BY IMPROVING AND VALIDATING TAPERED LAD DESIGNS AS WELL AS STRENGTHENING THE KNOWLEDGE OF FUNDAMENTAL FORCES THAT AFFECT GAS/LIQUID BEHAVIOR IN MICROGRAVITY. A RELIABLE PASSIVE LIQUID DELIVERY SYSTEM WOULD REDUCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPLEX PROPELLANT TANK DESIGNS TO MANAGE CRYOGENIC FLUIDS AND PROPELLANT LOSS FROM THRUSTING IN ORDER TO ORIENT THE ULLAGE IN THE TANK.

WHEN THE SEPARATION DISTANCES AMONG SURFACES ARE LESS THAN TENS TO HUNDREDS OF NANOMETERS, THE RADIATION SPECTRUM CAN BE CONFINED TO A VERY NARROW BAND, WHERE THE RADIATION INTENSITY CAN BE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE HIGHER THAN THE BLACKBODY LIMIT. THIS MICROSCALE PHENOMENON IS CALLED NEAR-FIELD THERMAL RADIATION. THE HIGH-INTENSITY ENERGY TRANSPORT IN NEAR-FIELD RADIATION CAN BE VALUABLE IN CONSTRUCTING HIGH EFFICIENCY, HIGH POWER DENSITY THERMAL ENGINES FOR THERMAL TO ELECTRIC ENERGY CONVERSION SUCH AS THERMOPHOTOVOLTAICS, THEREBY REDUCING THE FUEL CONSUMPTION IN TRANSPORTATION AND ELECTRICITY GENERATION. HOWEVER, IMPLEMENTING NEAR-FIELD THERMAL RADIATION CAN BE CHALLENGING IN PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS BECAUSE THE REQUIRED TENS TO HUNDREDS OF NANOMETER SEPARATION DISTANCE BETWEEN HOT AND COLD SURFACES ARE DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN. THIS STUDY WILL EXTEND THE USEFUL RANGE OF NEAR-FIELD THERMAL RADIATION TO MICRON-LEVELS BY AMPLIFYING THE NON-RADIATIVE THERMAL ELECTRIC FIELD AND THE RESULTING TUNNELING DISTANCE BETWEEN HOT AND COLD SURFACES. THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS BUILT UPON THE INVESTIGATOR'S EXPERTISE IN NEAR-FIELD ENERGY TRANSPORT AND THE DESIGN/FABRICATION OF NANO-OPTICAL RESONATORS THAT CAN AMPLIFY THE THERMAL ELECTRIC FIELD WITH ULTRA-THIN METASURFACE STRUCTURES. THE PROJECT TASKS ARE TO FIRST INTEGRATE DIELECTRIC OPTICAL ANTENNA THEORY WITH WIENER CHAOTIC EXPANSION TO UNDERSTAND RESONANCE, AMPLIFICATION, AND RADIATIVE ENERGY TUNNELING BETWEEN TWO LOSSY SOLIDS ACROSS A VACUUM GAP WITH APPROPRIATE HIGH-QUALITY FACTORS DIELECTRIC OPTICAL RESONATORS (DORS) UNDER DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR THE DETERMINATION OF THE TUNNELING FREQUENCIES, EFFICIENCIES, AND DISTANCES BETWEEN TWO SOLIDS AS FUNCTIONS OF DOR DESIGNS. THEORETICAL THERMAL EFFICIENCIES OF ENERGY HARVEST SYSTEMS USING THE ENHANCED LONG-DISTANCE TUNNELED RADIATIVE HEAT TRANSFER SCHEME WITH A CONSIDERATION OF PARASITIC HEAT CONDUCTION AND QUANTUM EFFICIENCIES OF PHOTOVOLTAIC DEVICES WILL THEN BE STUDIED AS A FUNCTION OF RADIATION INTENSITIES AND OUTPUT VOLTAGES. THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED WILL BE VALUABLE IN CONSTRUCTING HIGH-EFFICIENCY, HIGH-POWER DENSITY, LIGHTWEIGHT THERMAL ENGINES USING CURRENTLY AVAILABLE ENGINEERING TECHNIQUES, WHICH CAN HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND THE ASSOCIATED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND INCREASE THE NATION'S ENERGY SECURITY.

ENGINE MODELING ACCOMPLISHED DURING PHASE I HAS SHOWN THAT WE CAN EXPECT 2.5 TO 5 N OF THRUST PER MEGAWATT OF FUSION POWER  WITH AN ISP OF ABOUT 10 000 SECONDS AND 200 KW AVAILABLE AS ELECTRICAL POWER. WE HAVE EVALUATED THE COMPONENTS OF THE PLUTO TRAJECTORY INCLUDING AN EARTH DEPARTURE SPIRAL  CONSTANT THRUST PLANAR TRANSFER  AND PLUTO INSERTION USING THESE THRUST AND ISP LEVELS  AND CONFIRMED THE PLAUSIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED MISSION. IN FACT  THE MISSION CAN DEPART FROM LEO WITH ABOUT THE MASS WE ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED FOR AN INTERPLANETARY INSERTION  WIDENING THE RANGE OF AVAILABLE LAUNCH VEHICLES AND REDUCING THE COST. THE KEY OBJECTIVE OF THE PHASE II PROPOSAL IS TO FURTHER ADVANCE THE DESIGN AND TRL OF SELECTED SUBSYSTEMS  SUCH AS THE SUPERCONDUCTING COILS  RF HEATING  AND SHIELDING. PPPL WILL PERFORM EXPERIMENTAL WORK ON THE EXISTING PFRC-2 TESTBED USING A GAS PUFF VALVE  TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE THE DYNAMICS OF THE THRUST AUGMENTATION SYSTEM (ADDITIONAL GAW FLOWING THROUGH THE FRC SCRAPE-OFFLAYER). WE WILL EXPLORE THE DESIGN OF A NO-THRUST MODE THAT CAPTURES AND REUSES THE PROPELLANT  POSSIBLY EXTRACTING MORE POWER WHILE IN ORBIT AROUND PLUTO. FINALLY  WE WILL DEVELOP A MODEL OF THE SYNCHROTRON RADIATION THAT IS SPECIFIC TO THE FRC CONFIGURATION  AS AVAILABLE MODELS ARE DERIVED FROM TOKAMAKS. DIRECT FUSION DRIVE IS A UNIQUE FUSION ENGINE CONCEPT WITH A PHYSICALLY FEASIBLE APPROACH THAT WOULD DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE CAPABILITY OF OUTER PLANET MISSIONS. THE FUSION-ENABLED PLUTO MISSION PROPOSED HERE IS CREDIBLE  EXCITING  AND THE BENEFITS TO THIS AND ALL OUTER PLANET MISSIONS ARE DIFFICULT TO OVERSTATE. THE TRULY GAME-CHANGING LEVELS OF THRUST AND POWER IN A MODESTLY SIZED PACKAGE COULD INTEGRATE WITH OUR CURRENT LAUNCH INFRASTRUCTURE WHILE RADICALLY EXPANDING THE SCIENCE CAPABILITY OF THESE MISSIONS.,NON,,Q,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_NNX17AJ81G_8000/,2017-12-22 16:57:37.595105+00

FOR EXAMPLE, THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY HAS ENABLE TO DETERMINE THE MOST RELEVANT DOCUMENTS IN RESPONSE TO A QUERY EVEN WHEN SOME QUERY KEYWORDS MAY NOT APPEAR IN THESE DOCUMENTS. THE MAIN DRAWBACK OF USING DEEP NEURAL MODELS FOR RANKING IS THAT THE RETRIEVAL IS EXTREMELY TIME CONSUMING. AS A RESULT, SUCH MODELS CANNOT BE DEPLOYED IN MANY PRACTICAL SEARCH APPLICATIONS. THIS PROJECT IS FOCUSED ON STUDYING EFFICIENT SOLUTIONS TO PERFORM NEURAL RANKING COMPUTATION AND THE DEVELOPED TECHNIQUES WILL BE EVALUATED USING PUBLIC DATASETS TO ASSESS THE SOLUTION?S EFFECTIVENESS. THE PROJECT INTEGRATES THE RESEARCH WITH AN EDUCATIONAL PLAN INCLUDING UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS' INVOLVEMENT, INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIAL DEVELOPMENT, AND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES. THIS PROJECT CARRIES OUT A TWO-THRUST RESEARCH AGENDA FOR EFFICIENT NEURAL RANKING. THE FIRST THRUST INVESTIGATES A FAST RE-RANKING SCHEME FOR A DUAL-ENCODING ARCHITECTURE BY LEVERAGING PRECOMPUTED EMBEDDINGS TO COMPOSE A QUERY REPRESENTATION WITH APPROXIMATION, AND COMBINING DEEP CONTEXTUAL TOKEN INTERACTIONS AND TRADITIONAL LEXICAL MATCHING FEATURES. THE SECOND THRUST OF THIS PROJECT INVESTIGATES A COMPACT REPRESENTATION OF DOCUMENT EMBEDDINGS AND STRIKE A BALANCE OF RELEVANCE AND SPACE EFFICIENCY WHICH AFFECTS ONLINE INFERENCE LATENCY. THE PROJECT EXPLOITS THE COMPOSITE NATURE OF RANKING INFERENCE FOR ANSWERING A QUERY TO APPROXIMATE QUERY EMBEDDINGS, AND DECOUPLES RANKING CONTRIBUTION OF DOCUMENT EMBEDDINGS IN DERIVING A COMPACT REPRESENTATION. THIS RESEARCH WILL ADVANCE OUR FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF RELEVANCE AND EFFICIENCY TRADEOFFS IN NEURAL INFORMATION RETRIEVAL, AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE COMPUTING AND SPACE COST OF ONLINE INFERENCE WHILE RETAINING THE ESSENTIAL BENEFITS OF DEEP LEARNING FOR EFFECTIVE RANKING ON AFFORDABLE COMPUTING PLATFORMS.

ACCORDING TO CURRENT STANDARD OF CARE, COLONIC POLYPS ARE REMOVED BY THE ENDOSCOPIST, AND THEN FIXED, STAINED AND SECTIONED BEFORE BEING DIAGNOSED BY A PATHOLOGIST. HERE WE PROPOSE TO USE SOCT TO ALLOW THE PHYSICIAN TO BETTER IDENTIFY POTENTIALLY PRECANCEROUS POLYPS OR TISSUES DURING THE ENDOSCOPIC PROCEDURE. TO MEET THIS OBJECTIVE, WE PROPOSE TO CREATE AN OCT SYSTEM SUITABLE FOR USE DURING COLONOSCOPY BASED ON LUMEDICA’S PROPRIETARY OCT ENGINE TECHNOLOGY. LUMEDICA’S OCT SYSTEMS ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE HIGH PERFORMANCE AT LOW COST BUT ALSO ENABLE EASILY CONFIGURABLE PARAMETERS, SUCH AS IMAGING SPEED, IMAGING RESOLUTION AND DEPTH. FOR THIS PROJECT A NOVEL SCANNING PROBE WILL BE DESIGNED THAT CAN BE DEPLOYED DURING COLONOSCOPY, AND YET IS INEXPENSIVE ENOUGH TO BE SINGLE-USE, I.E. DISPOSABLE. THE PROBE WILL ALSO BE DESIGNED TO FIT IN WITH THE STANDARD WORKFLOW OF ENDOSCOPY. INSTEAD OF REQUIRING THE USE OF THE BIOPSY CHANNEL OF THE COLONOSCOPE FOR ACCESS, THE LOW COST OCT GI PROBE WILL BE AFFIXED TO THE OUTER HOUSING OF THE ENDOSCOPE, ALLOWING THE PHYSICIAN TO EXAMINE REGIONS OF INTEREST AND THEN ACQUIRE A BIOPSY OR REMOVE A POLYP WITHOUT REMOVING THE OCT PROBE. FINALLY, WE WILL EXTEND CLINICAL UTILITY BY EXPANDING THE SPECTRAL RANGE OF THE LOW COST OCT SYSTEM TO PERMIT USE OF SOCT TO OBTAIN FUNCTIONAL INFORMATION BY QUANTITATIVELY ANALYZING THE SCATTERING AND ABSORPTION PROPERTIES OF THE TISSUE AS A MEANS TO IMPROVE DIAGNOSIS. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, WE PROPOSE THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) INSTRUMENT DEVELOPMENT: WE WILL IMPLEMENT A NEW OCT INSTRUMENT FOR EXAMINATION OF COLORECTAL POLYPS WITH POTENTIAL FOR COMMERCIAL TRANSLATION TO CLINICAL USE. THE INSTRUMENT WILL INCLUDE A LOW COST OCT ENGINE, UPGRADED TO ENABLE SPECTROSCOPIC OCT MEASUREMENTS AND A NOVEL PROBE DESIGN THAT IS SUFFICIENTLY INEXPENSIVE TO BE SINGLE USE. THE PROBE DESIGN WILL BE DIFFERENT FROM PREVIOUS OCT EFFORTS, USING AN APPROACH WHICH FITS INTO THE ENDOSCOPIC WORKFLOW BY AVOIDING THE NEED TO INSERT AND RETRACT THE PROBE FOR MEASUREMENTS. 2) SOCT TISSUE STUDIES: THE NEW SOCT INSTRUMENT WILL BE APPLIED TO EXAMINATION OF RESECTED COLON POLYPS TO IDENTIFY OPTICAL SPECTROSCOPIC SIGNATURES OF PRE-MALIGNANCY OR ADENOMAS. THE PROBE WILL BE ALSO BE APPLIED DURING ENDOSCOPIC PROCEDURES TO VALIDATE ITS ABILITY TO INTERFACE WITH THE COLONIC MUCOSA WHILE ALSO PERMITTING A COLLOCATED BIOPSY TO BE ACQUIRED. ACHIEVING THESE SPECIFIC AIMS WILL DEMONSTRATE FEASIBILITY OF LOW COST SOCT FOR EVALUATING COLORECTAL EPITHELIAL TISSUES AND PROVIDE JUSTIFICATION FOR FURTHER COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT.",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,R,SMALL BUSINESS,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_R41EB032693_7529/,2022-06-14 17:36:42.521441+00

ACCURATE IDENTIFICATION, CHARACTERIZATION, AND QUANTITATION OF PROTEOFORMS IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL FOR UNDERSTANDING PROTEIN ROLES IN HUMAN DISEASE. TOP-DOWN PROTEOMICS FOCUSES ON THE DIRECT ANALYSIS OF PROTEOFORMS, PROVIDING THE SPECIFICITY NEEDED TO UNCOVER THE PRECISE MOLECULAR PARTICIPANTS IN BIOLOGICAL PHENOMENA. THE LANDSCAPE OF PROTEOMICS HAS BEEN CHANGING FROM DIGESTION- BASED METHODS TO INTACT PROTEIN ANALYSES, WITH TOP-DOWN PROTEOMICS GAINING A FOOTHOLD IN IMPORTANT BIOMEDICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL STUDIES.

AS MANY NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS HAVE THEIR GENESIS IN FETAL LIFE, THERE IS A NEED TO ACCURATELY QUANTIFY NORMAL AND ABNORMAL FETAL BRAIN DEVELOPMENT FROM BOTH THE PERSPECTIVE OF FETAL BRAIN STRUCTURE AND BODY MOTION. BETTER IMAGING TOOLS WOULD ENABLE US TO EXPLORE HOW FETAL NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AS WELL AS ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES, SUCH AS OPIOIDS, MATERNAL OBESITY, OR COVID-19, IMPACT EARLY BRAIN STRUCTURE AND BODY MOVEMENTS. MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) T2-WEIGHTED, SINGLE-SHOT FAST-SPIN-ECHO (E.G. HASTE) IMAGES PROVIDE A UNIQUE WINDOW INTO THIS CRITICAL PHASE OF STRUCTURAL BRAIN DEVELOPMENT, WITH THE POTENTIAL TO DETECT SUBTLE ABNORMALITIES. HOWEVER, FETAL BRAIN MRI IS CHALLENGING DUE TO FETAL MOTION, WHICH LEADS TO IMAGE ARTIFACTS, DOUBLE OBLIQUE ACQUISITIONS AND INCOMPLETE BRAIN COVERAGE. AS A RESULT, TRAINED MR TECHNOLOGISTS MUST “CHASE THE FETUS” TO AMASS THE NECESSARY IMAGES TO DIAGNOSE THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF LESIONS, RESULTING IN LONG SCAN TIMES AND HIGHER RF ENERGY DEPOSITION. THUS, FETAL BRAIN MRI IS INEFFICIENT, LIMITED TO SPECIALIZED CENTERS, AND DIAGNOSIS IS STILL DIFFICULT BECAUSE FETAL MOTION RESULTS IN EACH IMAGE BEING AN INDEPENDENT SLICE THAT CANNOT BE REFERENCED TO ANOTHER SLICE, MAKING CONFIRMATION OF SUSPICIOUS FINDINGS DIFFICULT. AT THE SAME TIME, FETAL MOTION IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE OF FUNCTIONAL NEUROLOGICAL INTEGRITY, INFORMING POSTNATAL OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, CURRENT CLINICAL MR AND ULTRASOUND ASSESSMENTS OF FETAL MOTION DO NOT FULLY CAPTURE THE COMPLEX 3D MOTIONS OF ALL BODY PARTS SIMULTANEOUSLY. BETTER ASSESSMENT OF FETAL NEUROLOGICAL HEALTH REQUIRES NOVEL TOOLS TO AUTOMATICALLY AND EFFICIENTLY OBTAIN COHERENT, HIGH QUALITY HASTE FETAL BRAIN VOLUMES AND TO CHARACTERIZE 3D FETAL WHOLE-BODY MOTION. TO ADDRESS THESE UNMET NEEDS, WE WILL LEVERAGE CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) MODELS AND PROPOSE THE FOLLOWING AIMS: (1) DEVELOP A SELF-DRIVING ENGINE FOR EFFICIENT ACQUISITION OF HIGH-QUALITY HASTE FETAL BRAIN VOLUMES AND (2) ENABLE AUTOMATED FETAL WHOLE-BODY MOTION TRACKING AND CHARACTERIZATION. WE WILL DEPLOY THE PROPOSED TOOLS IN A PROSPECTIVE STUDY THAT COMPARES FETUSES WITH CHIARI II MALFORMATION (SPINA BIFIDA), A DISORDER KNOWN TO HAVE BRAIN ABNORMALITIES AND OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED LEG MOVEMENT, TO TYPICAL FETUSES WITH THE FOLLOWING AIM: (3) ASSESS PERFORMANCE OF THE SELF-DRIVING HASTE ENGINE AND WHOLE-BODY MOTION CHARACTERIZATION IN CHIARI II VS TYPICAL FETUSES. FOR AIMS 1 AND 2, WE WILL INCLUDE DATA FROM COLLABORATING SITES AND STRATEGIES FOR CNN GENERALIZATION TO INCREASE ROBUSTNESS AND POTENTIAL TO DEPLOY OUR TOOLS TO OTHER SCANNERS. THE ABILITY TO AUTOMATICALLY OBTAIN HIGH-QUALITY COHERENT FETAL BRAIN VOLUMES AND CHARACTERIZE FETAL MOTION WILL IMPROVE STRATIFICATION FOR FETAL TREATMENTS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF RESPONSE TO FETAL INTERVENTIONS. SUCCESS WILL ALSO ENABLE SITES WITHOUT FETAL IMAGING EXPERTS TO LOCALLY ASSESS AND TRIAGE FETUSES WITH SUSPECTED ABNORMALITIES TO SPECIALIZED TREATMENT CENTERS, AS WELL AS FACILITATE LARGE POPULATION-BASED STUDIES TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES ON EARLY BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND FETAL BEHAVIOR.",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,M,NONPROFIT WITH 501C3 IRS STATUS (OTHER THAN AN INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION),2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_R01EB032708_7529/,2022-07-05 21:06:35.08119+00

THE SOLUTION IS TO IMPROVE GEOMETRIC COVERAGE USING LARGE AXIAL FOV FOR TOTAL-BODY IMAGING WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE SENSITIVITY BY ABOUT 40 TIMES COMPARED TO EXISTING COMMERCIAL WHOLE-BODY PET SCANNERS. THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE WORLD'S FIRST TOTAL-BODY PET/CT SCAN-NER, CALLED EXPLORER, WITH 194-CM AXIAL FOV HAS RECENTLY BEEN COMPLETED. HOWEVER, IT HAS A POOR TIME-OF-FLIGHT (TOF) RESOLUTION OF 430 PS, COMPARED TO THE STATE-OF-THE-ART WHOLE-BODY PET SCANNER WITH 200 PS TIMING RESOLUTION (SIEMENS BIOGRAPH VISION). IN ADDITION, AXIAL DETECTOR PENETRATION OF OBLIQUELY INCIDENT GAMMA PHOTONS DETECTED WITHIN THIS WIDE ACCEPTANCE ANGLE WILL INTRODUCE SIGNIFICANT DEPTH-OF-INTERACTION (DOI) PARALLAX ERROR, LEADING TO DEGRADED SPATIAL RESOLUTION. THESE TWO MAJOR DEFI-CIENCIES OF THE EXPLORER SCANNER OFFSET ITS EFFECTIVE SENSITIVITY GAIN, SPECIALLY FOR IMAGING SINGLE ORGANS SUCH AS THE HUMAN BRAIN WHEN COMPARED TO THE BIOGRAPH VISION PET SCANNER. FOR THIS RESEARCH, WE PROPOSE TO BUILD COST-EFFECTIVE BLOCK DETECTORS WITH COMBINED HIGHEST SPATIAL RESOLUTION (2 MM), HIGHEST TOF RESOLUTION (<120 PS AND POTENTIALLY 100 PS), BEST DOI LOCALIZATION (1.85 MM), AND HIGHEST INTER- CRYSTAL COMPTON SCATTER RECOVERY CAPABILITIES (88%) USING SINGLE-ENDED READOUT AND MACHINE LEARNING POST-PROCESSING ENGINES. OUR NOVEL DETECTOR MODULE, CALLED PRISM-PET, ENABLES THESE CAPABILITIES BY MIMICKING VERY CLOSELY THE BEHAVIOR OF DUAL-ENDED READOUT WITH ENHANCED AND CONTROLLED LIGHT SHARING USING A SEGMENTED ARRAY OF RIGHT ANGLE PRISM-MIRROR LIGHT GUIDES. GIVEN OUR PROMISING PRELIMINARY EX-PERIMENTAL RESULTS, WE AIM TO ACCOMPLISH THE FOLLOWING TASKS: (1) MODEL A PROTOTYPE TOF-DOI PET SCANNER USING GATE MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS AND USE ITS LIST-MODE DATA TO DEVELOP OUR TOF-DOI IMAGE RECONTRUCTION; (2) BUILD PRISM-PET DETECTOR MODULES AND CHARACTERIZE COINCIDENCE DETECTOR BLOCKS FOR DOI-CORRECTED SPATIAL RESOLUTION, ENERGY RESOLUTION, AND TIMING RESOLUTION AND USE MACHINE LEARNING TO RECOVER INTER-CRYSTAL COMPTON SCATTERED EVENTS TO REACH THE 2-MM INTRINSIC SPATIAL RESOLUTION WITHOUT SACRIFICING SENSITIVITY; (3) BUILD A ONE-RING PROTOTYPE PRISM-PET SCANNER; (4) PERFORM NORMALIZATION SCAN, OPTIMIZE OUR IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION USING EXPERIMENTAL COINCIDENCE EVENTS AND VALIDATE THE OPTIMAL IMAGING PERFORMANCE USING HOT SPOT PHANTOMS.

TURBULENT COMBUSTION OCCURS AND PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN MANY ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS JET ENGINES, GAS TURBINE GENERATORS, INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES, AND CHEMICAL PROCESSING PLANTS. THE MODERN DESIGN PROCESS OF SUCH DEVICES NEEDS TO EMPLOY NUMERICAL MODELING TO EVALUATE DESIGN CHOICES AND TO OPTIMIZE DESIGN PARAMETERS. HOWEVER, THE CURRENT STATE-OF-THE ART MODELING APPROACH, LARGE-EDDY SIMULATION (LES), DESPITE DECADES OF RESEARCH EFFORTS, STILL DOES NOT HAVE THE ACCURACY NEEDED FOR ADVANCED ENGINEERING DESIGN, PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE UNRESOLVED MIXING PROCESS IS NOT WELL PREDICTED. PREVIOUS EFFORTS TO UNDERSTAND MIXING HAD BEEN PARTIALLY HAMPERED BY THE PREDOMINANT LES APPROACH. THIS RESEARCH WILL INVESTIGATE MIXING USING THE NOVEL LES APPROACH DEVELOPED BY S. B. POPE AS THE FRAMEWORK, WHICH OVERCOMES THE LIMITATIONS OF THE TRADITIONAL APPROACH. THE NEW APPROACH, HOWEVER, ALSO POSES CHALLENGES IN EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES AND DATA ANALYSIS METHODS. THE RESEARCHERS WILL EMPLOY A NEW LASER DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUE AND NEW STATISTICAL ANALYSIS METHOD. THE RESEARCH WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCE THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS IN TURBULENT COMBUSTION, WHICH WILL POTENTIALLY ENABLE DEVELOPMENT OF COMBUSTION MODELS WITH SUFFICIENT ACCURACY FOR DESIGNING HIGH-PERFORMANCE AND LOW EMISSION ENGINEERING DEVICES, WHICH WILL HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON SOCIETY AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE PHYSICS GAINED WILL ALSO BENEFIT OTHER RESEARCH AREAS INVOLVING INTERACTIONS BETWEEN TURBULENCE AND STRONGLY NONLINEAR PHENOMENA, SUCH AS CHEMICAL ENGINEERING PROCESSES, ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS, ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY, AND ENVIRONMENT SYSTEMS. THIS PROJECT INVESTIGATES THE PHYSICAL-SPACE STRUCTURE AND THE UNRESOLVED MIXING AS WELL AS THEIR INTERACTION WITH CHEMISTRY USING THE RECENTLY DEVELOPED SELF-CONDITIONED FIELDS LES APPROACH (POPE 2010) AS THE FRAMEWORK, WHICH OVERCOMES THE LIMITATIONS OF THE FILTERING LES APPROACH. THE RESEARCHERS WILL CONDUCT EXPERIMENTS IN TURBULENT NON-REACTIVE COAXIAL JETS AND IN JET FLAMES. TWO-DIMENSIONAL IMAGES WILL BE OBTAINED IN COAXIAL JETS. A NEW PHOTO-DISSOCIATION-BASED DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUE AND NEW STATISTICAL ANALYSIS METHOD WILL BE USED. DIRECT NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF A SYDNEY FLAME (THORSTEN ET AL. 2019), WHICH CONTAINS 3D IMAGES, WILL COMPLEMENT THE EXPERIMENTS. RESEARCHERS WILL ANALYZE THE PHYSICAL-SPACE SCALAR STRUCTURE AND ITS REPRESENTATION IN THE SELF-CONDITIONED JOINT PDF AND THE UNCLOSED MIXING TERMS IN ITS TRANSPORT EQUATION. THE RESULTS PROVIDE A BASIS FOR INVESTIGATING THE MIXING OF MIXTURE FRACTION AND TEMPERATURE IN PILOTED TURBULENT PARTIALLY PREMIXED (SANDIA) FLAMES. THE RESEARCHERS WILL ANALYZE THE EFFECTS OF THE PHYSICAL-SPACE SCALAR STRUCTURE ON THE SELF-CONDITIONED SCALAR JMDF AND THE UNCLOSED MIXING TERMS. THE PROJECT IS THE FIRST TO USE THE NOVEL SELF-CONDITIONED LES APPROACH AS THE FRAMEWORK. IT IS ALSO THE FIRST TIME TRUE TWO-DIMENSIONAL IMAGES OF MIXTURE FRACTION AND TEMPERATURE WITH RESOLVED DISSIPATION SCALES ARE OBTAINED IN TURBULENT HYDROCARBON FLAMES WITHOUT MAJOR COMPROMISING ASSUMPTIONS.

THE MASSIVE DATA VOLUMES OF THESE DATASETS  DEMANDING UP TO AN ESTIMATED 100 TB OF STORAGE FOR A SET OF ANALYSIS ACTIVITIES TO BE COMPLETED  IS A BARRIER TO THEIR USE. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A TOOL  HY-LATIS  TO FACILITATE THE USE OF HYPERSPECTRAL DATA (HD) BY PROVIDING CONVENIENT ACCESS TO AND OPERATIONS OVER THE MASSIVE DATA VOLUMES THEY PRESENT. THE DATA WILL BE STORED IN THE CLOUD WHERE SERVER-SIDE COMPUTATIONS CAN BE PERFORMED.   USERS WILL BE ABLE TO ANALYZE DATA IN THE CLOUD USING A NOTEBOOK APPROACH THAT ENABLES PROCESSING TO OCCUR IN THE CLOUD WITHOUT REQUIRING DATASET DOWNLOAD TO USER WORKSTATIONS. THEY WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO REDUCE HD AND STREAM IT INTO LOCAL MEMORY FOR THE PURPOSE OF INTEGRATING HYPERSPECTRAL INFORMATION INTO EXISTING SEQUENTIAL ANALYSES.  OVERALL  HD WILL BE EASIER TO ACCESS AND USE  WITH BETTER INTERACTIVITY IN ANALYSES THAN IS AVAILABLE TODAY.  THE WILL BE ACHIEVED BY PUTTING A FUNCTIONAL DATA PROCESSING LAYER OVER THE SPARK BIG DATA PROCESSING ENGINE  LEVERAGING THE EXISTING LATIS DATA ACCESS SERVER AND FRAMEWORK AS THE FUNCTIONAL DATA PROCESSING LAYER. LATIS HAS BEEN IN USE AT THE LABORATORY FOR ATMOSPHERIC AND SPACE PHYSICS (LASP) FOR MANY YEARS  WITH ABOUT 20 INSTANCES CURRENTLY RUNNING  SERVING A WIDE VARIETY OF DATASETS FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF DOMAINS  FORMATS  AND LOCATIONS.

THIS PROJECT EXPANDS THE SPARK INTERFACE TO OFFER NOT ONLY THE RELATIONAL DATA MODEL INTERFACE THAT IT DOES NOW  BUT ALSO A FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE IN THE FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING SENSE.  THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY IMPLEMENTING THE LATIS FUNCTIONAL DATA MODEL AND ASSOCIATED HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGING ANALYSIS (HIA) OPERATIONS WITH A FUNCTIONAL STYLE  WHILE LEVERAGING THE POWER OF SPARK UNDERNEATH. WE ARGUE THAT A FUNCTIONAL APPROACH TOWARDS DATA AND PROCESSING PROVIDES A FLEXIBILITY OF REPRESENTATION COUPLED WITH THE RIGHT SET OF SEMANTICS TO BE A VERY GOOD APPROACH FOR SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS.  THIS TWO-YEAR PROJECT WILL START WITH THE TECHNICAL TEAM WORKING WITH OUR SCIENCE CO-IS  WHO ARE OUR SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS (SMES)  TO DEVELOP A CORE HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGE ANALYSIS (HIA) DOMAIN TOOL SET THAT SUPPORTS HD ANALYSIS IN THE CODE AND STREAMING INTO MEMORY REDUCED VOLUME HD. THE TOOL SET WILL PROVIDE AN INTUITIVE INTERFACE DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY AT THE LEVEL OF HIA.   THE FIRST OPERATIONS TO IMPLEMENT WILL BE ACCESS OPERATIONS  SUCH AS SUBSETTING ON GEOLOCATION  WAVELENGTH  OR PIXEL.  THE SECOND SET OF OPERATIONS WILL BE SERVER SIDE ANALYSES  SUCH AS VARIOUS FORMS OF INTEGRATION TO BE APPLIED TO REDUCE THE DATA VOLUME TO A LOWER RESOLUTION.  AFTER THIS WORK IS UNDERWAY  AND DEPENDING ON THE TIMING OF THE NEEDS OF OUR SMES  NEW ANALYSES AND UNDERLYING OPERATIONS WILL BE DEVELOPED THAT LEVERAGE HY-LATIS OPERATIONS VIA NOTEBOOK TECHNOLOGIES  SUCH AS JUPYTER NOTEBOOK OR JUPYTERLAB.  THIS IS WHERE THE TRUE INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCE WILL LIE.  INSTEAD OF THE BATCH ORIENTED HIA PRACTICES OF TODAY  THIS APPROACH WILL SAVE TIME BY REDUCING OR ELIMINATING THE TEDIOUS DOWNLOAD-EXTRACT-OPERATE PROCESSING NOW REQUIRED.  ONCE THE CAPABILITIES OF SUBSETTING  INTERPOLATING  AND PERFORMING A FEW OTHER ESSENTIAL OPERATIONS ARE OPERATIONAL IN A NOTEBOOK ENVIRONMENT  THE HY-LATIS DEVELOPMENT TEAM WILL HOLD A WORKSHOP TO DEMONSTRATE THE TOOL TO THE EARTH ATMOSPHERE REMOTE SENSING COMMUNITY.

ALTHOUGH ASSOCIATED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS ARE TYPICALLY UTILIZED IN THEIR NATURAL EQUILIBRIUM STEADY STATES IN THREE DIMENSIONS, THEORETICAL STUDIES SUGGEST THE POSSIBILITY OF REALIZING NEW CAPABILITY WHEN THE CONSTITUENT ELECTRONS IN THESE MATERIALS ARE ARTIFICIALLY REARRANGED, SUCH AS CONFINING THEM ONLY TO TWO-DIMENSIONS. THIS RESEARCH EXAMINES THE ELECTRONIC PROPERTIES OF TWO-DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS SUBJECTED TO EXCITATION FROM LOW ENERGY LIGHT SOURCES IN SEARCH OF PREDICTED PHYSICAL PHENOMENA, WITH A VIEW TOWARDS POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS. THIS RESEARCH IS TIMELY BECAUSE RECENT ADVANCES IN ATOMICALLY LAYERED MATERIALS HAS GREATLY EXPANDED BOTH THE UNIVERSE OF AVAILABLE MATERIALS FOR SUCH STUDIES AND SCOPE OF OBSERVABLE NEW PHENOMENA. THIS RESEARCH PROJECT IS CARRIED OUT AT GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY, ONE OF THE UNIVERSITIES WHICH SERVES THE MOST DIVERSE POPULATION IN THE NATION. IT WILL INVOLVE UNDERGRADUATE AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, INCLUDING THOSE FROM HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS AND WOMEN, AND TRANSLATE THEIR ABILITIES INTO THE PURSUIT OF CAREER PATHS IN THE STEM FIELD, BY PROVIDING THEM EARLY EXPOSURE TO A SUPPORTIVE, CONFIDENCE BUILDING, RESEARCH EXPERIENCE. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO HELP TO ADD UNDERREPRESENTED SECTIONS OF SOCIETY TO THE NATION?S SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY SKILL BASE FOR THE ELECTRONICS, PHOTONICS, DEFENSE, AND WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: THIS RESEARCH EXPERIMENTALLY EXAMINES THE MAGNETOELECTRONIC RESPONSE UNDER LOW ENERGY STEADY STATE PHOTOEXCITATION OF SEMICONDUCTOR HETEROSTRUCTURES AND 2D ATOMIC-LAYERED MATERIALS INCLUDING MONO-LAYER, BILAYER, AND TWISTED BILAYER GRAPHENE, ATOMICALLY THIN HEXAGONAL BORON NITRIDE (H-BN), AND POSSIBLY TRANSITION METAL-DICHALCOGENIDES. PHOTO-EXCITED TRANSPORT UNDER STEADY STATE LOW ENERGY PHOTOEXCITATION IS MOSTLY UNEXPLORED IN THE ABOVE-MENTIONED MATERIAL SYSTEMS PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE EXPERIMENTAL DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED IN SIMULTANEOUSLY BRINGING TOGETHER HIGH MAGNETIC FIELDS, LOW TEMPERATURES, LOW ENERGY PHOTOEXCITATION OVER A WIDE BAND, WITH GOOD QUALITY SAMPLES. THE RESEARCH TEAM CONSISTING OF GRADUATE STUDENTS, UNDERGRADUATES, AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, WILL BUILD UP LAYERED SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES AND 2D ATOMIC-LAYERED CRYSTALS BY APPLYING ELECTRON BEAM LITHOGRAPHY, PLASMA ETCH, AND METALLIZATION; AND EXAMINE THE PROPERTIES OF ELECTRICALLY CONTACTED AND NON-CONTACTED DEVICES IN THE PRESENCE OF A MAGNETIC FIELD UNDER MICROWAVE, MM-WAVE, AND TERAHERTZ PHOTOEXCITATION. HERE, SOME SPECIFIC PROBLEMS OF INTEREST INCLUDE THE STUDY, TO MEASURE PARTICLE CHARACTERISTICS, OF RADIATION-INDUCED MAGNETORESISTANCE OSCILLATIONS AND ASSOCIATED ZERO-RESISTANCE STATES, FOR ELECTRONS AND COMPOSITE FERMIONS, IN THE PARABOLIC GAAS/ALGAAS AND BILAYER GRAPHENE SYSTEMS, AS WELL AS IN THE LINEARLY DISPERSED MONOLAYER GRAPHENE SYSTEM. ANOTHER AIM IS TO CLARIFY THE DEPENDENCE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL FIELD FOR THE RADIATION INDUCED OSCILLATIONS FOR BOTH ELECTRONS AND COMPOSITE FERMIONS ON THE FERMI WAVE VECTOR IN MONOLAYER GRAPHENE. IN THE TWISTED BILAYER GRAPHENE SYSTEM, ONE AIM IS TO STUDY THE VELOCITY RENORMALIZATION VERSUS THE TWIST ANGLE.

DFD IS BASED ON THE PRINCETON FIELD-REVERSED CONFIGURATION (PFRC) FUSION REACTOR UNDER DEVELOPMENT AT THE PRINCETON PLASMA PHYSICS LABORATORY. THE MISSION CONTEXT WE ARE PROPOSING IS DELIVERY OF A PLUTO ORBITER WITH A LANDER. THE KEY OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSAL IS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED PLUTO SPACECRAFT USING IMPROVED ENGINE MODELS. DFD PROVIDES HIGH THRUST TO ALLOW FOR REASONABLE TRANSIT TIMES TO PLUTO WHILE DELIVERING SUBSTANTIAL MASS TO ORBIT: 1000 KG DELIVERED IN 4 TO 6 YEARS. SINCE DFD PROVIDES POWER AS WELL AS PROPULSION IN ONE INTEGRATED DEVICE  IT WILL ALSO PROVIDE AS MUCH AS 2 MW OF POWER TOTHE PAYLOADS UPON ARRIVAL. THIS ENABLES HIGH-BANDWIDTH COMMUNICATION  POWERING OF THE LANDER FROM ORBIT  AND RADICALLY EXPANDED OPTIONS FOR INSTRUMENT DESIGN. THE DATA ACQUIRED BY NEW HORIZONS' RECENT PLUTO FLYBY IS JUST A TINY FRACTION OF THE SCIENTIFIC DATA THAT COULD BE GENERATED FROM AN ORBITER AND LANDER.WE HAVE EVALUATED THE PLUTO MISSION CONCEPT USING THE LAMBERT ALGORITHM FOR MANEUVERS WITH ROUGH ESTIMATES OF THE ENGINE THRUST AND POWER. THE ACCELERATION TIMES ARE SUFFICIENTLY SHORT FOR THE LAMBERT APPROXIMATION  I.E. IMPULSIVE BURNS  TO HAVE SOME VALIDITY.WE HAVE USED FUSION SCALING LAWS TO ESTIMATE THE TOTAL MISSION MASS AND SHOW THAT IT WOULD FIT WITHIN THE ENVELOPE OF A DELTA IV HEAVY LAUNCH VEHICLE. ESTIMATES OF THE AMOUNT OF HELIUM 3 REQUIRED TO FUEL THE REACTOR ARE WITHIN AVAILABLE TERRESTRIAL STORES.IN THIS PHASE I STUDY  WE PROPOSE TO ANALYZE THE PLUTO MISSION CONCEPT USING NEW MODELS OF THE ENGINE. WE WILL DEVELOP AN OPTIMAL TRAJECTORY INCLUDING LIMITS ON THE THRUST STEERING AND RANGE OF THROTTLE. THE THROTTLING OF THE THRUST AND SPECIFIC IMPULSE WILL AFFECT THEEFFICIENCY  WHICH WE HAVE NOT YET ATTEMPTED TO MODEL. WE WILL GIVE A SUBCONTRACT TO PRINCETON PLASMA PHYSICS LABORATORY TO BEGIN THIS INVESTIGATIONTHE SUBTASKS ARE:1. ANALYZE ALL SUBSYSTEMS AND PRODUCE AN IMPROVED MASS MODEL;2. ANALYZE SHIELDING REQUIREMENTS ON A COMPONENT LEVEL AND PRODUCE AN IMPROVED SHIELDING; DESIGN AND NEUTRON RADIATION MITIGATION STRATEGY3.

USING THE NEW MASS AND THRUST AUGMENTATION MODEL GENERATE AN OPTIMAL PLUTO MISSION TRAJECTORY;5. REVISIT THE SYSTEM DESIGN AND PRODUCE A NEW SPACECRAFT MODEL.DIRECT FUSION DRIVE IS A UNIQUE FUSION ENGINE CONCEPT WITH A PHYSICALLY FEASIBLE APPROACH THAT WOULD DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE CAPABILITY OF OUTER PLANET MISSIONS. THE FUSION-ENABLED PLUTO MISSION PROPOSED HERE IS CREDIBLE  EXCITING  AND THE BENEFITS TO THIS AND ALL OUTER PLANET MISSIONS ARE DIFFICULT TO OVERSTATE.

MODERN QUESTION ANSWERING SYSTEMS, EMBEDDED IN SEARCH ENGINES AND DIGITAL ASSISTANTS, HAVE IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF LARGE NEURAL NETWORK MODELS. WHEN A USER ASKS A SIMPLE QUESTION, THESE SYSTEMS CAN TYPICALLY RETURN AN ANSWER DIRECTLY RATHER THAN JUST LINKING TO A WEBPAGE. HOWEVER, THESE SYSTEMS STILL FAIL ON MORE COMPLEX QUESTIONS, AND WHEN THEY FAIL, THEY MAY MISLEAD THEIR USERS. THEY LACK AN IMPORTANT CAPABILITY THAT HUMANS HAVE: THE ABILITY TO REASON ABOUT AND SYNTHESIZE THE INFORMATION THEY SEE, RETRIEVE AND INTEGRATE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, AND ARRIVE AT A JUSTIFIED CONCLUSION. THIS CAREER PROJECT AIMS TO ADDRESS THIS SHORTCOMING BY DEVELOPING SYSTEMS THAT THINK THROUGH TEXTUAL EVIDENCE, LEADING TO MORE RELIABLE ANSWERS THAT CAN BE EXPLAINED TO A USER. SUCH ADVANCES FIT INTO A BROADER THREAD OF BUILDING TRUSTABLE AI SYSTEMS THAT EXPLICITLY SHOW THEIR WORK AND ARE AUDITABLE BEFORE AND DURING THEIR DEPLOYMENT. THIS PROJECT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THE PROBLEMS OF QUESTION ANSWERING AND FACT-CHECKING BY DEVELOPING A LEARNING-BASED SYSTEM THAT REASONS IN NATURAL LANGUAGE. THE SYSTEM TAKES TEXT AS INPUT, THEN APPLIES PRE-TRAINED NEURAL NETWORK MODELS TO REFORMULATE THAT TEXT, DERIVE CONCLUSIONS FROM IT, AND EVENTUALLY CHECK A CLAIM OR VERIFY AN ANSWER. THIS PROCESS PRODUCES A SERIES OF LOGICALLY CONNECTED STATEMENTS UNDERSTANDABLE BY A HUMAN. THIS OUTCOME IS ENABLED BY TWO MODULES. FIRST, A DEDUCTION MODULE REPEATEDLY COMBINES TWO STATEMENTS AND GENERATES A THIRD THAT FOLLOWS FROM THE INPUTS, ENCAPSULATING COMMON LOGICAL RULES. SECOND, A VERIFIER DETERMINES WHETHER THE FINAL DEDUCED EVIDENCE VALIDATES THE ORIGINAL CLAIM. BOTH SYSTEMS ARE BUILT FROM PRE-TRAINED MODELS LIKE T5 THAT HAVE DEMONSTRATED STRONG GENERALIZATION CAPABILITIES. COLLECTING TRAINING DATA FOR THESE MODELS CONSTITUTES A CORE CHALLENGE; THE PROJECT'S APPROACH BLENDS MULTIPLE STRATEGIES INCLUDING SYNTHETIC DATA GENERATION AND HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP ANNOTATION. THESE TECHNIQUES ARE APPLIED TO THE DOMAINS OF QUESTION ANSWERING AND FACT CHECKING, PROBLEMS WHERE PROVIDING ADDITIONAL EXPLANATION AND JUSTIFICATION INSTEAD OF JUST GIVING A BEST-EFFORT ANSWER ARE ESSENTIAL TO MAKE USABLE SYSTEMS. THIS SYSTEM PAVES THE WAY FOR NLP TOOLS THAT KNOW WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW, PROVIDE INTERPRETABILITY FOR END USERS, AND ENABLE SYSTEM DEVELOPERS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND IMPROVE THEIR MODELS.

AGE-RELATED MUSCLE WASTING AND WEAKNESS (SARCOPENIA) ARE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTORS TO THESE PHY- SICAL IMPAIRMENTS, INCLUDING MOST NOTABLY GAIT IMPAIRMENT. MOREOVER, SARCOPENIA IS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RISK OF FALLS AND OTHER INJURIES LEADING TO LOSS OF INDEPENDENCE AND INCREASED MORTALITY. HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS OF OAS NEED IMPROVED MEANS OF EVALUATING LOWER EXTREMITY MUSCLE CONDITION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SARCOPENIA. MRI, CT, AND DXA PROVIDE CONSIDERABLE INFORMATION, BUT NONE ARE OFFICE-BASED AND DXA ONLY PROVIDES INFORMATION ON LEAN BODY MASS AND FAT CONTENT. IN THIS APPLICATION, WE ADVANCE ELECTRICAL IMPEDANCE MYOGRAPHY (EIM) FOR ASSESSMENT OF LOWER EXTREMITY MUSCLE CONDITION IN OAS. EIM RELIES UPON APPLICATION OF DIRECTIONALLY FOCUSED, MULTI-FREQUENCY ELECTRICAL CURRENT TO SPECIFIC MUSCLES OR MUSCLE GROUPS. BY APPLYING THE TECHNOLOGY IN SUCH A LOCALIZED FASHION, IT IS VIRTUALLY UNAFFECTED BY HYDRATION STATUS OR OTHER ISSUES THAT COMMONLY IMPACT OTHER BIOIMPEDANCE-BASED METHODS. EIM HAS BEEN STUDIED FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES IN THE FIELD OF NEUROMUSCULAR DISEASE AND HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE SENSITIVE TO A VARIETY OF ALTERATIONS IN SKELETAL MUSCLE INCLUDING ATROPHY, DEGENERATION, AND SIMPLE DECONDITIONING. TAKING EIM ONE STEP FURTHER AND APPLYING MACHINE LEARNING (ML) TECHNIQUES TO THE COMPLEX MULTIFREQUENCY EIM DATA SET, IT EVEN BECOMES POSSIBLE TO PREDICT HISTOLOGICAL FEATURES, INCLUDING MYOFIBER SIZE, FAT, AND CONNECTIVE TISSUE CONTENT. GIVEN THIS DEMONSTRATED CAPABILITY, EIM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SERVE AS A CONVENIENT, OFFICE-BASED APPROACH FOR ASSESSING MUSCLE HEALTH IN OAS. IN THIS DIRECT-TO-PHASE 2 SBIR APPLICATION, MYOLEX PROPOSES TO ESTABLISH EIM, VIA ITS NEW DEVICE, THE MSCAN, IN CONJUNCTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING CLOUD-BASED PLATFORM, AS A MEANS OF OBTAINING MRI-LIKE QUANTITATIVE DATA IN MUSCLE OF OAS. IN SPECIFIC AIM 1, IN CONJUNCTION WITH AGING EXPERT RESEARCHERS AT 3 DIFFERENT CLINICAL SITES, WE WILL COLLECT MRI AND EIM DATA ON A COHORT OF HEALTHY OLDER ADULTS, ALONG WITH STANDARD FUNCTIONAL MEASURES AS WELL AS MEASURING SPECIFIC FORCE, VIA ELECTRICALLY STIMULATED MUSCLE CONTRACTION. USING THIS DATA, IN SPECIFIC AIM 2, WE WILL DEVELOP PREDICTIVE ALGORITHMS, VIA THE PENALIZED REGRESSION TECHNIQUE OF LASSO (LEAST ABSOLUTE SHRINKAGE AND SELECTION OPERATOR), LEVERAGING EIM VALUES TO PREDICT MUSCLE VOLUME, MUSCLE SPECIFIC FORCE, AND MUSCLE FATTY INFILTRATION. WE WILL THEN INCORPORATE THESE ALGORITHMS INTO A CLOUD-BASED ENGINE THAT WILL PROVIDE MEANINGFUL, EASY-TO-INTERPRET VALUES.

SEEJ WILL USE REVOLUTIONARY MINIATURE X-RAY OPTICS TO OBTAIN GOOD COLLECTING AREA IN A LOW MASS  SMALL VOLUME AND LOW-COST PACKAGE. SEEJ WILL OBSERVE SCORES OF TRANSITS OF SELECT SYSTEMS TO MAKE DETAILED MEASUREMENTS OF THE TRANSIT DEPTH AND SHAPE WHICH CAN BE COMPARED TO OUT-OF-TRANSIT BEHAVIOR OF THE TARGET SYSTEM. OVER THE LAST DECADE  THE DISCOVERY OF EXOPLANETS HAS FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED OUR PERCEPTION OF THE UNIVERSE AND HUMANITY S PLACE WITHIN IT. THE FIRST AND EASIEST DETECTED EXOPLANETS FOUND WERE  HOT JUPITERS ; THESE ARE LARGE JUPITER LIKE PLANETS IN CLOSE ORBITS TO THEIR HOST STAR. IN THE CASES OF STARS WITH SIGNIFICANT X-RAY EMISSION  THE X-RAY FLUX LIKELY CHANGES THE EVOLUTION OF THE OVERALL STARPLANETARY SYSTEM IN AT LEAST TWO WAYS: (1) THE INTENSE HIGH ENERGY FLUX ALTERS THE THERMAL BUDGET OF THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE OF THE PLANET; (2) THE ANGULAR MOMENTUM AND MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE PLANET INDUCES EVEN MORE ACTIVITY ON THE STAR  ENHANCING ITS X-RAYS  WHICH ARE THEN SUBSEQUENTLY ABSORBED BY THE PLANET. DURING A TRANSIT  THIS ABSORPTION ACTS AS A UNIQUE AND FORTUITOUS PROBE OF THE PLANETARY EXOSPHERE. FURTHERMORE  THE HOT JUPITER INDUCED EXCESS ACTIVITY OF THE HOST STAR CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE THE CHEMISTRY OF ANY ADDITIONAL PLANETS IN THE HABITABLE ZONE OF THE STAR  AND THUS THE EVOLUTION OF LIFE IN THE SYSTEM. USING CHANDRA  POPPENHAEGER ET AL. MONITORED MULTIPLE TRANSITS OF THE HOT JUPITER HD189733B. THEY MEASURED THE TRANSIT DEPTH AND WIDTH IN X-RAYS AND DETECTED A TRANSIT AT A DEPTH OF 7%  3 TIMES DEEPER THAN THE ~2% OPTICAL ECLIPSE DEPTH. THIS IMPLIED A SOFT (<1 KEV) X-RAY SIZE NEARLY TWICE THE OPTICAL RADIUS OF THE PLANET. THIS DISCOVERY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT  WITH THE EXISTING TECHNOLOGY  MODEL ATMOSPHERES OF HOT JUPITERS CAN BE CHARACTERIZED  AND ASYMMETRIES MEASURED. THIS IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING CAN  IN TURN  CONSTRAIN THE LOSS OF ATMOSPHERES IN EXOEARTHS AROUND M-STARS. MULTIPLE OBSERVATIONS OF EXO-PLANET TRANSITS ARE REQUIRED IN THE X-RAY DUE TO STOCHASTIC NOISE (I.E. FLARES) AND THUS CONCERTED MONITORING EFFORTS REQUIRE AN UNREASONABLE RESOURCE LEVEL OF THE GENERAL PURPOSE X-RAY OBSERVATORIES (CHANDRA AND XMM-NEWTON). SEEJ WILL BE PURPOSE BUILT TO MONITOR EXOPLANET TRANSITS IN X-RAYS MULTIPLE TIMES TO BUILD UP SIGNAL TO NOISE AND PROVIDE DETAILED TRANSIT LIGHT CURVE PROFILES. THE KEY TO MEASURING SMALL CHANGES ON STOCHASTICALLY VARIABLE SOURCES IS TO MONITOR MANY TRANSITS TO FILTER OUT THE FREQUENT FLARES THAT M-STARS SUFFER. FOLLOW UP XMM-NEWTON OBSERVATIONS OF HD 189733 WERE COMPROMISED BY BACKGROUND FLARES. THE LOSS OF LOW ENERGY SENSITIVITY IN CHANDRA PRECLUDES FOLLOW UP. NO SUITABLE INSTRUMENT IS PLANNED UNTIL ATHENA NET 2030. CARRYING A TRIO OF SPECIALIZED TELESCOPES USING MINIATURE X-RAY OPTICS (MIXO) AND CMOS SENSORS DEVELOPED AT THE SMITHSONIAN ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY (SAO)  SEEJ  WILL MONITOR MANY (~75) TRANSITS OF UP TO 10 X-RAY BRIGHT EXOPLANET HOSTS WITH TRANSITING HOT JUPITERS THAT WILL BE FOUND BY TESS  WITH NEAR CHANDRA AREA IN A SINGLE YEAR.

IT WILL FUND RESEARCH THAT ENABLES RELIABLE ASSURANCE OF SAFETY-CRITICAL METAL COMPONENTS, FOR EXAMPLE THOSE USED IN THE AEROSPACE AND NUCLEAR POWER INDUSTRIES, THEREBY PROMOTING THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE, AND ADVANCING THE NATIONAL PROSPERITY AND WELFARE. THERMOMECHANICAL PROCESSES THAT OCCUR DURING MANUFACTURING OF METAL PARTS RESULT IN GRAIN MICROSTRUCTURES THAT DICTATE STRENGTH, FATIGUE LIFE, AND CREEP AND CORROSION RESISTANCE. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THESE MICROSTRUCTURES BE CAREFULLY CONTROLLED DURING PRODUCTION AND NON-DESTRUCTIVELY CHARACTERIZED ONCE A COMPONENT IS FINISHED. ALTHOUGH ULTRASOUND TECHNOLOGY IS THE ONLY PRACTICAL MEANS TO ACCESS INTERNAL MATERIAL PROPERTIES, IT HAS SEEN VERY LIMITED INDUSTRIAL USAGE, AS ACCURATE INTERPRETATION OF ULTRASONIC SIGNALS IN TERMS OF SUCH MICROSTRUCTURE REMAINS AN UNSOLVED PROBLEM. ALTERNATIVE TECHNIQUES THAT RELY ON DESTRUCTIVE TESTING OF SACRIFICIAL SAMPLES AFTER ELABORATE PREPARATION ARE RECOGNIZED AS INADEQUATE, AS EVIDENCED FOR EXAMPLE BY FAILURES OF AIRCRAFT ENGINES. THIS PROJECT WILL OVERCOME THESE SHORTCOMINGS BY ADVANCING A NEW METHOD OF INTERPRETING ULTRASONIC WAVE SCATTERING DUE TO MICROSTRUCTURAL TEXTURE AND INHOMOGENEITIES, POTENTIALLY REVOLUTIONIZING THE USE OF NON-DESTRUCTIVE, CONTACTLESS, ULTRASONIC CHARACTERIZATION THROUGHOUT PRODUCTION AND IN SERVICE, AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES AND ON COMPLEX SHAPES. THIS CAPABILITY WILL SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF NEW ADVANCED MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, WHOSE VITAL NEED OF QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE ON COMPLEX GEOMETRIES IS CURRENTLY ONLY PARTIALLY MET.

THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO MAKE FUNDAMENTAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ULTRASONIC DIFFUSE WAVE FIELD METHOD THAT ENABLES VOLUMETRIC CHARACTERIZATION OF MISSION CRITICAL MICROSTRUCTURE OF ENGINEERING METALS. IT WILL ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE BY DESIGNING AND CALIBRATING EXPERIMENTAL TRANSDUCTION MECHANISMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING TECHNIQUES FOR EXTRACTING THE FULL GREEN?S TENSOR FROM THE DIFFUSE WAVE FIELD ON DIFFERENT SAMPLE GEOMETRIES, AND RELATING PROPERTIES OF DIFFUSIVITY, ATTENUATION, AND SCATTERING TO MICROSTRUCTURE-RELATED PROPERTIES. FURTHER, A GENERAL MULTIPLE SCATTERING THEORY WILL BE DERIVED IN COMBINATION WITH RADIATIVE TRANSFER THEORY, TO ACCOUNT FOR THE EFFECTS OF TEXTURE AND MICROSTRUCTURES ON COHERENT WAVES AND TO DESCRIBE THE INCOHERENT WAVE DIFFUSION. COMPUTATIONAL MODELS OF SUCH WAVE DIFFUSION WILL BE VALIDATED AGAINST EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND USED TO CONSTRUCT A KNOWLEDGE DATABASE OF QUANTITATIVE LINKAGES BETWEEN THE DIFFUSE WAVE FIELD AND MATERIAL MICROSTRUCTURES. FINALLY, A ROBUST INVERSION METHOD WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR DEDUCING CRITICAL MICROSTRUCTURAL PROPERTIES FROM THE DIFFUSE WAVE FIELD DATA.

HOWEVER HIGHER CHAMBER PRESSURES RESULT IN HIGHER HEAT FLUXES THROUGH THE WALLS. THIS PLACES GREATER STRESS ON THE COOLING SYSTEMS. FUEL FILM COOLING IS AN EFFECTIVE METHOD TO REDUCE THE HEAT FLUX  HOWEVER SINCE THE FUEL IS NOT COMBUSTED IT REDUCES PERFORMANCE OF THE ENGINE. FURTHERMORE  AN ISSUE WITH USING KEROSENE AS COOLANT IS COKING THAT RESULTS FROM THE THERMAL DECOMPOSITION OF THE PROPELLANT. THIS DECREASES HEAT TRANSFER AND REDUCES THE LIFESPAN OF THE CHAMBER MATERIAL. THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY STUDIED IN REGENERATIVE COOLED CHAMBERS BUT THE MECHANISMS FOR COKE FORMATION HAVE NOT BEEN WELL ESTABLISHED. ADDITIONALLY  IN A FUEL FILMED COOLED CHAMBER THE PROCESS IS MUCH MORE COMPLICATED WITH COKING RESULTING FROM INTERACTIONS WITH THE LIQUID FILM AND GASEOUS CORE FLOW. CURRENTLY THE ONLY MODELS THAT EXIST FOR COKING HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR THE CHEMICAL AND PETROLEUM INDUSTRIES. THE CONDITIONS INSIDE A ROCKET COMBUSTION CHAMBER HOWEVER ARE MUCH MORE SEVERE AND EXTRAPOLATION OF EXISTING MODELS WILL RESULT IN LARGE ERROR. THEREFORE COKING MODELS FOR ROCKET CONDITIONS ARE IN NEED OF DEVELOPMENT. FOR THIS PROJECT  AN EXPERIMENTAL AND COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH IS PROPOSED TO UNDERSTAND THE COKING PHENOMENA AT ROCKET CONDITIONS. EXPERIMENTS WILL BE DONE TO STUDY COKING BEHAVIOR IN A HEATED PIPE REACTOR FOR THE LIQUID FUEL AND FOR COMBUSTED GASEOUS PRODUCTS. SEM AND AN X-RAY ELEMENTAL DETECTION ANALYSIS WILL BE PERFORMED TO DETERMINE THE CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COKE LAYER. THE RESULTS WILL BE COMPARED WITH ANOTHER EXPERIMENT THAT WILL INVOLVE COKING IN A LIQUID FUEL FILM AND GASEOUS CORE FLOW ENVIRONMENT. EXISTING COKE MODELS WILL BE MODIFIED TO MATCH THE DATA AT THE HIGHER PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE CONDITIONS FROM THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS. THE END RESULT WOULD BE AN EXPERIMENTALLY VALIDATED COKING MODEL THAT WOULD SERVE TO AID IN THE DESIGN OF FUTURE REUSABLE LIQUID BOOSTER ENGINES AND ADVANCE NASA S LAUNCH PROPULSION SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP.,NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,H,PUBLIC/STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_NNX16AM86H_8000/,2021-04-07 16:24:23.345082+00

THIS NOVEL TECHNIQUE WILL FACILITATE COASTAL MONITORING AT SPATIAL RESOLUTIONS COMPARABLE TO AIRBORNE SURVEYS BUT AT THE DESIRED TEMPORAL FREQUENCY OF A SATELLITE CONSTELLATION. THIS ADVANTAGEOUS COMBINATION WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO GATHER TIMELY INFORMATION ABOUT SHORELINE CHANGES IN THE AFTERMATH OF MAJOR STORMS AND DETECT ONGOING SMALL-SCALE CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO SEA LEVEL RISE  AMONG OTHER APPLICATIONS. OBJECTIVES: THE CENTRAL OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDE (1) DEVELOPING AN AUTOMATED SHORELINE MAPPING METHODOLOGY USING EMERGING IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES (MACHINE LEARNING) AND GEOSPATIAL PLATFORMS (GOOGLE EARTH ENGINE)  (2) ASSESSING THE ACCURACY OF SHORELINE POSITIONS DERIVED FROM SMALLSAT IMAGERY BY COMPARISON TO MEAN HIGH WATER SHORELINE POSITIONS INTERPRETED FROM UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEM (UAS) IMAGERY  AND (3) IDENTIFYING THE SMALLSAT DATA PRODUCT BEST SUITED FOR COASTAL MONITORING BASED ON SHORELINE ACCURACY AND SURVEY FREQUENCY. METHODS: THE FIRST COMPONENT INVOLVES ACQUISITION OF UAS IMAGERY AT THREE COASTAL STUDY AREAS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT WILL SERVE AS VALIDATION DATASETS FOR THE SMALLSAT-DERIVED SHORELINE POSITIONS. THE SECOND COMPONENT INVOLVES THE GENERATION OF UAS PHOTOGRAMMETRY PRODUCTS AND VALIDATION DATA. THE UAS IMAGERY WILL BE USED TO GENERATE GEOREFERENCED DIGITAL SURFACE MODELS (DSM)  FROM WHICH MEAN HIGH WATER (MHW) SHORELINE POSITIONS WILL BE INTERPRETED AND USED TO ASSESS THE ACCURACY OF SHORELINES INTERPRETED FROM SMALLSAT IMAGERY. ULTRA-HIGH RESOLUTION ORTHOPHOTO MOSAICS WILL ALSO BE GENERATED FROM THE UAS IMAGERY  WHICH WILL BE USED TO ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFIER USED TO AUTOMATICALLY INTERPRET THE SHORELINE POSITION. THE THIRD AND FINAL COMPONENT IS DEVELOPING THE AUTOMATED SHORELINE EXTRACTION TECHNIQUE USING MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFICATION. ALL OF THE IMAGE PROCESSING AND ANALYSIS TASKS WILL BE PERFORMED IN GOOGLE EARTH ENGINE AND SCRIPTS WILL BE DISSEMINATED TO PUBLIC REPOSITORIES TO ENCOURAGE FUTURE USE. FINALLY  THE ACCURACY OF SHORELINES DERIVED FROM THE VARIOUS SMALLSAT PRODUCTS WILL BE ASSESSED BY COMPARISON TO THE UAS MHW SHORELINE POSITION. SIGNIFICANCE TO CSDAP: THIS PROPOSAL FALLS WITHIN THE GENERAL SCOPE OF A.42 AND ADDRESSES STRATEGIC GOAL 1 OF NASA S 2018 STRATEGIC PLAN. THE MOST IMPORTANT OUTCOME OF THIS PROPOSAL WILL BE ITS CONTRIBUTION AS A SOCIETAL BENEFIT AND APPLICATION FOR NATURAL HAZARD PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE. SANDY COASTLINES ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO GLOBAL SEA-LEVEL RISE AND IT'S PREDICTED THAT HALF OF THE WORLD'S BEACHES COULD BE COMPLETELY ERODED BY 2100. CALIFORNIA S DUNE-BACKED SHORELINES ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE  AND THE U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY HAS ESTABLISHED A COASTAL CHANGE HAZARDS PORTAL TO PROVIDE SCIENTIFICALLY CREDIBLE DATA TO HELP MANAGE THESE COASTAL HAZARDS. THE MOST RECENT STATEWIDE SHORELINE MAPPED BY THE USGS WAS IN 2002 DUE TO THE HIGH ACQUISITION COSTS OF AIRBORNE SURVEYING AND AS SUCH  THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR A SHORELINE MAPPING TECHNIQUE THAT TAKES ADVANTAGE OF MODERN SATELLITE TECHNOLOGY AND DATA ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES. THE PRODUCTS OF THIS RESEARCH WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ASSIST COASTAL LAND USE MANAGERS AND OTHER DECISION MAKERS WITH IDENTIFYING EROSIONAL HOT SPOTS THAT SHOULD BE TARGETED FOR RESTORATION EFFORTS. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL ALSO ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE AS IT WILL PROVIDE A GROUNDBREAKING TECHNIQUE FOR ASSESSING GLOBAL COASTAL CHANGE.

OBTAINING ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF TURBULENT FLOWS IS A CENTRAL CHALLENGE IN GLOBAL CHANGE ESTIMATION, WEATHER FORECASTING, FRESHWATER SUPPLY, IMPROVING THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF ENGINES, CONTROLLING DISPERSAL OF CONTAMINANTS, AND DESIGNING BIOMEDICAL DEVICES. A TURBULENT FLOW IS A HIGHLY IRREGULAR SYSTEM, CHARACTERIZED BY CHAOTIC PROPERTY CHANGES INVOLVING A WIDE RANGE OF SCALES IN NONLINEAR INTERACTION WITH EACH OTHER. THESE FEATURES YIELD A HIGH COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY, WHICH MAKES DIRECT NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS OF TURBULENT FLOWS THAT AIM AT RESOLVING ALL FEATURES DOWN TO THE SMALLEST SCALES INFEASIBLE EVEN WITH MODERN SUPERCOMPUTERS. INSTEAD, TURBULENCE MODELS ARE USED FOR PRACTICAL TURBULENCE SIMULATIONS TO BYPASS THE CHAOTIC DETAILS AND REDUCE THE COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP A NEW FAMILY OF ENSEMBLE AVERAGED TURBULENCE MODELS AND NOVEL NUMERICAL METHODS FOR THEIR SOLUTION, EXTENDING CURRENT APPLICABILITY AND COMPUTATIONAL LIMITATIONS OF EFFECTIVE TURBULENCE SIMULATIONS, WHICH MAY HAVE A GREAT IMPACT ON NUMEROUS APPLICATIONS IN AERONAUTICS, HYDRAULICS, CHEMICAL ENGINEERING, OCEANOGRAPHY, METEOROLOGY, ASTROPHYSICS, AND GEOPHYSICS, CONSIDERING TURBULENCE?S PROMINENT INFLUENCE IN ALMOST ALL GEOPHYSICAL AND INDUSTRIAL FLOWS. A COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM WILL BE DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH SYSTEMATIC TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS AND BRING THEM UP TO DATE ON CURRENT RESEARCH TOPICS IN THIS FIELD. TURBULENCE MODELING REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SCIENTIFIC CHALLENGES. THE FUNDAMENTAL APPROACH FOR TURBULENCE MODELING IS TO SEEK TO APPROXIMATE SUITABLE (ENSEMBLE, TIME, OR SPATIAL) AVERAGES OF FLUID VELOCITY INSTEAD OF POINTWISE VELOCITY ITSELF. ENSEMBLE AVERAGING IS THE MOST INTUITIVE APPROACH FROM THE STATISTICAL THEORY FOR TURBULENCE, BUT IT IS CURRENTLY NOT IN USE FOR PRACTICAL TURBULENCE SIMULATIONS OF INDUSTRIAL FLOWS DUE TO THE EXTREMELY HIGH COMPUTATIONAL COST ASSOCIATED WITH ENSEMBLE SIMULATIONS. THIS DEADLOCK IS RECENTLY BROKEN WITH NEWLY DEVELOPED ENSEMBLE ALGORITHMS THAT GIVE ACCESS TO THE FULL ENSEMBLE AT EVERY TIME STEP AND THUS OPEN NEW AND DIRECT POSSIBILITIES FOR DEVELOPING TURBULENCE MODELS FOR THE ENSEMBLE AVERAGED NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS. IN THIS PROJECT THE INVESTIGATOR WILL DEVELOP A NEW FAMILY OF ENSEMBLE-BASED VARIATIONAL MULTISCALE METHOD (VMS) TURBULENCE MODELS AND NOVEL NUMERICAL METHODS UNDER THE NEW FRAMEWORK OF ENSEMBLE AVERAGING FOR PRACTICAL TURBULENT FLOW SIMULATIONS. NEW UNCONDITIONALLY STABLE ENSEMBLE ALGORITHMS WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR FAST SOLUTION OF THE NEW ENSEMBLE-BASED VMS TURBULENCE MODELS AND TO EFFECTIVELY OVERCOME THE BACKFLOW INSTABILITY FOR TURBULENT FLOWS WITH OPEN BOUNDARY CONDITIONS. THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE NEW AVENUES TO TURBULENCE MODELING AND SIMULATIONS AND BUILD A NEW RIGOROUS NUMERICAL ANALYSIS ADDRESSING HOW TO MAKE EFFECTIVE APPROXIMATIONS IN THE FACE OF NEWTONIAN CHAOS.

GAS TURBINE ENGINES CONTAIN NICKEL ALLOY BLADES, WHICH MUST BE CAREFULLY INSPECTED AND REPAIRED AT REGULAR INTERVALS TO ENSURE FAILURE NEVER OCCURS UNEXPECTEDLY, AS IN-SERVICE FAILURES INEVITABLY RESULT IN CATASTROPHIC ENGINE DAMAGE. THE INTEGRITY OF REPAIRS IS LARGELY DEPENDENT UPON MECHANICAL PERFORMANCE OF FILLER ALLOYS DESIGNED TO PATCH CRACKS AND CAVITIES IN THE ENGINE BLADES, WHICH THIS PROJECT AIMS TO IMPROVE THROUGH NOVEL METALLURGICAL DESIGN GROUNDED IN FUNDAMENTAL SCIENCE. THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AT LARGE WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS RESEARCH, AS IT WILL PIONEER APPLIED DEVELOPMENT FOR ALLOYS WITHIN AN EMERGING MATERIAL CLASS ONLY TWO DECADES IN THE MAKING. DESIGNED ALLOYS WILL HAVE A COMMERCIAL ADVANTAGE OVER EXISTING REPAIR PRODUCTS DUE TO SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE AND SIMILAR COST. THIS ADVANTAGE WILL FORM THE CORE OF A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, WHICH WILL GENERATE REVENUE AND PROVIDE STEM JOBS AS THE BUSINESS EXPANDS. WHEN DESIGNING NEW ALLOYS FROM THE GROUND UP, RATHER THAN MAKING MODIFICATIONS TO EXISTING ALLOYS, LIMITLESS POSSIBILITIES ARISE IN MULTI-PRINCIPAL ELEMENT ALLOYS REGARDING WHICH METALLIC ELEMENTS TO INCLUDE AND IN WHAT CONCENTRATIONS, NECESSITATING A CAREFUL DESIGN STRATEGY TO EFFICIENTLY IDENTIFY CANDIDATES FOR A PARTICULAR APPLICATION. THIS PROJECT EMPLOYS, AS ITS STRONG TECHNICAL INNOVATION, A RIGOROUS ALLOY SELECTION STRATEGY GROUNDED IN FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS-BASED CALCULATIONS TO ACHIEVE THIS OUTCOME. EQUILIBRIUM AND NON-EQUILIBRIUM METALLURGICAL THERMODYNAMICS CALCULATIONS FORM THE CORE OF THE SELECTION STRATEGY, WITH THE AIM TO IDENTIFY ALLOY COMPOSITIONS IN WHICH PHASES DETRIMENTAL TO MECHANICAL PERFORMANCE ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE SUPPRESSED. THE PROJECT WILL DESIGN AND TEST ALLOYS TO ADDRESS CROSS-CUTTING INDUSTRIAL CHALLENGES ? FIRST AND FOREMOST, FILLING CRACKS IN COMPLEX NICKEL-BASE SUPERALLOYS DESIGNED FOR USE IN THE HARSH OPERATING ENVIRONMENT OF A GAS TURBINE ENGINE. MUCH OF THE SCOPE OF WORK IN THIS PROJECT WILL INVOLVE A VETTING PROCESS TO TEST WHETHER THE FILLER ALLOYS CAN WITHSTAND THESE HARSH CONDITIONS AFTER CRACK REPAIRS ARE PERFORMED.

HOWEVER, IT HAS BECOME NECESSARY TO BRING COMPUTATION CLOSE TO THE DATA SOURCES TO ADDRESS THE DATA PRIVACY, SYSTEM LATENCY, AND ENERGY CONSUMPTION CONCERNS, WHICH ARE CRITICAL IN APPLICATIONS SUCH AS HEALTHCARE, AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES, AND INTERNET-OF-THINGS. ANOTHER ARISING ISSUE RELATES TO THE TYPICAL USE OF DIGITAL SYSTEMS TO PERFORM THE NECESSARY COMPUTATIONS, BUT DIGITAL SYSTEMS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY LIMITED IN HANDLING BIG DATA EFFICIENTLY. ALTHOUGH ANALOG COMPUTATION EMERGED AS A PROMISING ALTERNATIVE, WHICH CAN OUTPERFORM ITS DIGITAL COUNTERPART BY SEVERAL ORDERS OF MAGNITUDES IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND COMPUTATIONAL SPEED, THIS ALTERNATIVE FACES MANY CHALLENGES. FIRST, EMERGING ANALOG MEMORIES ARE UNRELIABLE, IMMATURE, AND INCOMPATIBLE WITH STANDARD CMOS TECHNOLOGIES. SECOND, DESIGNING CUSTOMIZABLE AND SCALABLE ANALOG DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS THAT CAN SUPPORT A BROAD RANGE OF DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS IS HARDER THAN THE DIGITAL COUNTERPART, LEADING TO LONGER DESIGN CYCLES AND HIGHER COSTS. THE BROAD GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES BY USING INNOVATIVE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS IN BOTH ANALOG AND DIGITAL DESIGNS AT THE MEMORY TECHNOLOGY, CIRCUIT, ARCHITECTURE, AND SYSTEM LEVELS, THEREBY ENABLING HIGH SCALABILITY AND GREAT FLEXIBILITY FOR VARIOUS APPLICATIONS. THIS PROJECT WILL FIRST DEVELOP A SPECIALIZED ELECTRONIC CHIP WITH A NOVEL RECONFIGURABLE ARCHITECTURE AND A NEW MEMORY TECHNOLOGY, UTILIZING A SOFTWARE-HARDWARE CO-DESIGN APPROACH TO ACHIEVE THE NECESSARY OPTIMIZATIONS. SUBSEQUENTLY, THIS PROJECT WILL BUILD A SCALABLE SYSTEM UTILIZING MULTIPLE SUCH CHIPS TO ADAPT TO THE NEEDS OF EVEN LARGER NEURAL NETWORKS. THIS PROJECT WILL LIKELY IMPACT THE DESIGN OF FUTURE HARDWARE ACCELERATORS BECAUSE IT IMPROVES ENERGY EFFICIENCY, ENHANCES COMPUTATIONAL SPEED, AND ENRICHES THE FUNCTIONALITY OF DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS WHILE UNLOCKING NEW CAPABILITIES OF ANALOG COMPUTATIONS AND ALLOWING A MASSIVE DEPLOYMENT OF EDGE DEVICES. THE EDUCATIONAL ASPECTS INCLUDE FILLING THE GAP IN THE ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING CURRICULUM RELATED TO DEEP NEURAL NETWORK HARDWARE IMPLEMENTATION AND PROVIDING VARIOUS SKILLS TO PARTICIPATING STUDENTS, FOCUSING ON MINORITY AND UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS. THE EXTENSIVE OUTREACH ACTIVITIES INCLUDE DEVELOPING AND TEACHING TWO SUMMER PROJECT-ORIENTED COURSES IN MACHINE LEARNING AND CIRCUIT DESIGN FOR K-12 STUDENTS IN METRO DETROIT. THIS PROJECT PROPOSES MULTIPLE INNOVATIONS AT THE TECHNOLOGY, CIRCUIT, ARCHITECTURE, AND SYSTEM LEVELS. AT THE MEMORY TECHNOLOGY LEVEL, WE PROPOSE A NEW, CMOS-BASED, ANALOG MULTI-STABLE MEMORY CIRCUIT THAT OFFERS COMPATIBILITY WITH CROSSBAR SYSTEMS, PROVIDES AN ANALOG SOLUTION TO STORE THE WEIGHTS, AND PERFORMS LOCAL COMPUTATIONS IN A HIGHLY PARALLEL AND ENERGY-EFFICIENT MANNER. AT THE CIRCUIT LEVEL, WE PROPOSE A LOCAL STORAGE AND PROCESSING UNIT, WHICH EMPLOYS THE PROPOSED ANALOG MEMORY TO PERFORM MULTIPLY-AND-ACCUMULATE OPERATIONS, UTILIZING ONLY ONE MEMORY UNIT TO SUPPORT BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE WEIGHTS. AT THE ARCHITECTURE LEVEL, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL RECONFIGURABLE ARCHITECTURE TO CONSTRUCT A SCALABLE AND HIGHLY CUSTOMIZABLE INFERENCE ENGINE. IN THIS ARCHITECTURE, CROSSBAR CELLS CAN BE EXPANDED HORIZONTALLY AND/OR VERTICALLY USING SWITCH MATRIX CIRCUITS, THEREBY IMPROVING THE UTILIZATION AND REDUCING THE POWER CONSUMPTION COMPARED TO THE FIXED-SIZE AND SEPARATE CROSSBAR ARRAYS. MOREOVER, WE PROPOSE THE USAGE OF A POOL OF RECONFIGURABLE DIGITAL-TO-ANALOG CONVERTERS AND ANALOG-TO-DIGITAL CONVERTERS, WHICH ARE WELL SUITED FOR THE RECONFIGURABLE ARCHITECTURE, AND WILL OPTIMIZE THEIR BIT RESOLUTIONS FOR EACH DEEP NEURAL NETWORK LAYER. FURTHERMORE, THE PROPOSED INFERENCE ENGINE EMPLOYS A LOW-POWER OPEN-SOURCE PROCESSOR (SPECIFICALLY RISC-V) TO ENABLE HIGH FLEXIBILITY AND PROVIDE VARIOUS FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING THE MANAGEMENT OF THE DATA FLOW BETWEEN LAYERS, CONFIGURATION, AND CALIBRATION. TO MINIMIZE THE FETCH/DECODE ENERGY CONSUMPTION, CUSTOM DIGITAL CIRCUITS WILL BE DEVELOPED TO SUPPORT NON-LINEAR AND POOLING FUNCTIONS. TO ACCOUNT FOR PROCESS VARIATIONS, WE WILL EXPLOIT BUILT-IN-SELF-TEST AND BUILT-IN-SELF-CALIBRATION TECHNIQUES TO TEST AND CALIBRATE ALL THE ANALOG CIRCUITS, UTILIZING ON-CHIP CIRCUITS AND CONFIGURATION REGISTERS. FINALLY, AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL, MULTIPLE CHIPS WILL BE INTERCONNECTED THROUGH PCI EXPRESS TO SUPPORT LARGER MODELS.

EXTENSIVE TIME IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE EXPANSIVE SEARCH SPACE AND LACK OF EFFICIENT SEARCH TOOLS, WHEREAS THE COST IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO INFERIOR QUALITY DRUG CANDIDATES THAT FAIL IN CLINICAL TRIALS. HIGH-QUALITY SEARCH TOOLS ARE REQUIRED TO INCREASE THE VARIETY AND QUALITY OF DRUG CANDIDATES THAT ENTER OPTIMIZATION. WHILE HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING ASSISTED BY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) CAN SCREEN A LARGE POOL OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS QUICKLY TO NARROW DOWN CANDIDATES THAT POSSESS VARIOUS DESIRABLE PROPERTIES, A VERY LARGE FRACTION OF POTENTIAL SPACE FOR CANDIDATE DRUGS STILL GOES UNEXPLORED. FURTHERMORE, IT IS COMPUTATIONALLY EXPENSIVE AND INEFFICIENT IN SAMPLING THE DESIRED PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS IN SOLUTION SPACE WHICH GROWS EXPONENTIALLY WITH THE NUMBER OF MOLECULES. QUANTUM AI IS MORE EXPRESSIVE, I.E., IT CAN MODEL A TARGET PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION EVEN WITH A LIMITED NUMBER OF QUBITS AND PARAMETERS TO SAMPLE FROM THE UNEXPLORED REGIONS OF THE SEARCH SPACE. HOWEVER, THEIR TRUE POTENTIAL AND APPLICATION IN DRUG DISCOVERY REMAIN UNEXPLORED. THIS PROJECT WILL FILL THIS VOID BY CREATING QUANTUM MACHINE LEARNING (QML) MODELS THAT WILL EMPLOY NOISY QUANTUM COMPUTERS. IF SUCCESSFUL, THIS PROJECT WILL UNLEASH NEW COMPUTATIONAL CAPABILITIES IN DISCOVERY APPLICATIONS, E.G., BY SELECTING NOVEL LEAD CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS VERSUS IMPORTANT TARGET PROTEINS TO TREAT DISEASES, SUCH AS CANCER, BY CONVERGING MULTIPLE DISCIPLINES. THE GENERIC AND EXTENDIBLE QML TOOLSET WILL ENABLE THE USE OF QUANTUM COMPUTING FOR OTHER DISCOVERY APPLICATIONS, E.G., MATERIAL DISCOVERY. THIS PROJECT WILL ADVANCE QUANTUM COMPUTING AND QUANTUM AI BY ADDRESSING THE SCALABILITY ISSUE. IT WILL DEVELOP AN INTEGRATED INTRODUCTION TO QUANTUM COMPUTING AND APPLICATION FOR K-12 TEACHERS, INCLUDING A PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WORKSHOP AND CURRICULAR MATERIALS THAT ADDRESS LOCAL AND NATIONAL-LEVEL STANDARDS IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING EDUCATION. IT WILL ALSO DEVELOP UNDERGRADUATE COURSEWORK SUPPORTED BY PENN STATE QUANTUM MINOR PROGRAM TO PREPARE A QUANTUM-READY WORKFORCE. RESEARCHERS WILL DEVELOP DRUGVAE (A QUANTUM VARIATIONAL AUTOENCODER) TO SEARCH AND SCREEN LIGANDS AND QDOCK (A QUANTUM DOCKING ENGINE) TO VALIDATE THE LIGANDS AND AID IN SCREENING. VARIOUS SCALABILITY, APPLICATION-LEVEL PARALLELIZATION AND TRAINING APPROACHES FOR DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING WILL ALSO BE DEVELOPED. RESEARCHERS WILL OPTIMIZE AND PARALLELIZE, MAP, AND SCHEDULE THE QML WORKLOADS FROM DRUGVAE AND QDOCK INTO TARGET QUANTUM COMPUTERS CONSIDERING ARCHITECTURAL AND HARDWARE CONSTRAINTS FOR PERFORMANCE, RESILIENCE AND COST. THE OUTPUT FEATURES WILL BE PROVIDED TO THE CLASSICAL NEURAL NETWORK AS NEEDED. RESEARCHERS WILL COMPUTATIONALLY VALIDATE QML-GENERATED COMPOUNDS AGAINST SLOWER, TRADITIONAL DOCKING AS WELL AS EXPERIMENTALLY DETERMINED BINDING AFFINITIES. THE RESEARCH WILL PROVIDE MATERIALS FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND UNDERGRADUATE CURRICULUM. VARIOUS TASKS WILL BE SYNERGIZED THROUGH NOVEL TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS QML-SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATION, TARGET-SPECIFIC SEARCH AND REFINEMENT OF MODEL PARAMETERS, AND OPTIMIZATION BASED ON VALIDATION RESULTS. THIS PROJECT WILL COVER ALL LEVELS OF ABSTRACTIONS TO MEET THE END GOAL OF DRUG DISCOVERY, E.G., PROGRAM/CIRCUIT DESIGN, OPTIMIZATION, CIRCUIT-TO-ARCHITECTURE MAPPING, PARALLELIZATION, AND SCHEDULING.

IN 2008, THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH OPENED A REGIONAL BIOCONTAINMENT LABORATORY (RBL). RESEARCH AT THE RBL HAS GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THEN, WITH INVESTIGATORS WORKING ON SEVERAL HIGHLY INFECTIOUS MICROBIAL AGENTS REQUIRING BSL2 AND ABSL2 FACILITIES. CURRENT RBL RESEARCH PROJECTS COVER MULTIPLE VIRUSES IN 5 OF THE 7 RNA VIRUS FAMILIES OF PANDEMIC CONCERN AS DEFINED BY NIH, INCLUDING, BUNYAVIRALES, CORONAVIRIDAE, FLAVIVIRIDAE, PARAMYXOVIRIDAE, AND TOGAVIRIDAE. THE RBL IS AN INVALUABLE RESOURCE FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH, WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA, AND INSTITUTIONS IN THE US, EUROPE AND SOUTH AMERICA. INDEED, THE RBL RECEIVED THE SARS-COV-2 VIRUS IN MID-FEBRUARY, 2020, AND RECEIVED ALMOST $5M IN MARCH 2020 FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COALITION FOR EPIDEMIC PREPAREDNESS INNOVATIONS TO PURSUE VACCINE DEVELOPMENT FOR COVID-19. THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF THE RBL IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE US TO CONDUCT THE NECESSARY RESEARCH TO BE PREPARED FOR THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF VACCINES AND THERAPEUTICS IN RESPONSE TO FUTURE PANDEMICS SIMILAR TO THE RECENT SARS-COV-2. OVER THE LAST 14 YEARS, THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND FACILITIES IN THE RBL HAVE BEGUN TO DEGRADE, WITH SOME REACHING THE END OF THEIR USEFULNESS. THE FOCUS OF THIS APPLICATION IS TO MODERNIZE THE RBL THROUGH BOTH UPGRADES AND RENOVATIONS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ALLOW FOR CONTINUING CUTTING-EDGE RESEARCH ON INFECTIOUS AGENTS OF PANDEMIC CONCERN FOR MANY YEARS TO COME. AN EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT RBL IS A VITAL TOOL FOR PANDEMIC PREPAREDNESS. TO ACCOMPLISH OUR GOALS, 3 AREAS OF RBL FUNCTIONALITY AND EFFICIENCY WILL BE ADDRESSED. FIRST, WE WILL ENHANCE RBL SAFETY AND LONGEVITY. REPAIRS OR REPLACEMENTS WILL BE MADE TO THE BIO- CONTAINMENT FLOORING, THE SUPPLY AIR SYSTEM, THE EXHAUST SYSTEM, VARIABLE FREQUENCY DRIVES, CHILLER CONTROLS, STEAM WATER HEATERS, DIESEL ENGINE GENERATOR FUEL SYSTEM CONTROLS, FIRE ALARM SYSTEM, BUILDING AUTOMATION SYSTEM, WALK-IN COOLER, AND BIOMETRIC SECURITY. SECOND, THE EFFICIENCY OF RBL OPERATIONS WILL BE ENHANCED BY REPLACEMENT OF EXISTING SYSTEM LIGHTING WITH ENERGY-EFFICIENT LED LIGHTS AND REMOVAL OF A GAS PLASMA STERILIZER TO GENERATE MUCH NEEDED SPACE. THIRD, THE RESEARCH CAPACITY OF THE RBL WILL BE ENHANCED BY INCREASING RODENT HOUSING CAPACITY AND PURCHASING ADDITIONAL CAGING FOR NON-HUMAN PRIMATES, RABBITS, AND FERRETS. THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ENSURE THE RBL REMAINS FUNCTIONAL, EFFICIENT, AND READY FOR RAPID RESPONSE TO FUTURE EMERGING PANDEMICS.",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,X,OTHER,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_G20AI174724_7529/,2022-10-05 19:45:46.593103+00

MOLECULAR SIMULATIONS HAVE BECOME AN INVALUABLE TOOL FOR RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT IN CHEMICAL, PHARMACEUTICAL, AND MATERIALS SCIENCES. WITH THE AVAILABILITY OF SPECIALIZED HARDWARE SUCH AS GRAPHICS PROCESSING UNITS (GPUS), MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS USING CLASSICAL OR MOLECULAR MECHANICAL FORCE FIELDS HAVE REACHED THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES NEEDED TO ADDRESS IMPORTANT REAL-WORLD PROBLEMS IN THE CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES. FREE ENERGY SIMULATIONS ARE A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AND CHALLENGING CLASS OF MOLECULAR SIMULATIONS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO GAIN A PREDICTIVE UNDERSTANDING OF CHEMICAL PROCESSES. FOR EXAMPLE, FREE ENERGY METHODS CAN PREDICT THE BARRIER HEIGHT AND RATES FOR CHEMICAL REACTIONS, WHETHER A REACTION WILL OCCUR, OR HOW TIGHTLY A DRUG BINDS TO A TARGET. THESE PREDICTIONS ARE EXTREMELY VALUABLE FOR THE DESIGN OF NEW CATALYTIC AGENTS OR DRUGS. HOWEVER, THE PREDICTIVE CAPABILITY OF FREE ENERGY SIMULATIONS IS SENSITIVE TO THE UNDERLYING MODEL THAT DESCRIBES THE INTER-ATOMIC POTENTIAL ENERGY AND FORCES. ACCURATE FREE ENERGY SIMULATIONS OF CHEMICAL PROCESSES REQUIRE POTENTIAL ENERGY MODELS THAT CAPTURE THE ESSENTIAL PHYSICS AND CAN RESPOND TO CHANGES IN THE CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT, BUT CONVENTIONAL FORCE FIELD MODELS ARE UNSUITABLE FOR MANY PROCESSES INVOLVING BOND BREAKING AND FORMATION AS SEEN, FOR EXAMPLE, IN CATALYST DESIGN. CONSEQUENTLY, THERE IS GREAT NEED TO EXTEND THE SCOPE OF FREE ENERGY METHODS BY ENABLING THE USE OF A BROADER RANGE OF POTENTIAL ENERGY MODELS THAT ARE MORE ACCURATE AS WELL AS REACTIVE AND/OR CAPABLE OF QUANTUM MECHANICAL MANY-BODY POLARIZATION AND CHARGE TRANSFER. THE CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE CREATED BY THIS PROJECT ALLOWS FOR THE ROUTINE APPLICATION OF FREE ENERGY METHODS, USING QUANTUM MECHANICS, MACHINE LEARNING, REACTIVE AND CLASSICAL POTENTIALS TO A MYRIAD OF IMPORTANT PROBLEMS THAT ADVANCE THE STATE-OF-THE ART IN THE BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL SCIENCES. THE TOOLS CAN BE APPLIED BY A RANGE OF SCIENTISTS TO ADDRESS FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS OF NATIONAL INTEREST, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE DESIGN OF DRUGS AGAINST ZOONOTIC DISEASES (E.G., COVID-19), THE DESIGN OF MATERIALS WITH NOVEL FUNCTIONS AND IN THE DESIGN OF IMPROVED BATTERIES. GIVEN THE SOPHISTICATION OF THE METHODS EMPLOYED, EDUCATION OF A DIVERSE POOL OF CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND COMPUTER SCIENTISTS TO ADVANCE THIS FIELD IS ESSENTIAL AND IS ADDRESSED IN THIS PROJECT, THEREBY TRAINING THE NEXT GENERATION OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENTISTS THAT WILL FORM THE BACKBONE OF THE WORK FORCE OF THE FUTURE. THE PROJECT DEVELOPS ACCURATE AND EFFICIENT FREE ENERGY SOFTWARE WITHIN A POWERFUL NEW MULTISCALE MODELING FRAMEWORK IN THE AMBER SUITE OF PROGRAMS FOR APPLICATIONS IN CHEMISTRY, BIOLOGY, AND MATERIALS SCIENCE. THE MULTISCALE FRAMEWORK ENABLES THE DESIGN AND USE OF NEW CLASSES OF MIXED-METHOD FORCE FIELDS THAT INVOLVE INTEROPERABILITY BETWEEN SEVERAL EXISTING AND EMERGING REACTIVE, MACHINE LEARNING AND QUANTUM MANY-BODY POTENTIALS. THESE POTENTIALS HAVE ENHANCED ACCURACY, ROBUSTNESS, AND PREDICTIVE CAPABILITY COMPARED TO CLASSICAL MOLECULAR MECHANICAL FORCE FIELDS AND ENABLE THE STUDY OF CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND CATALYSIS. THE CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORTS INNOVATIVE MULTI-LAYERED HYBRID POTENTIALS THAT CAN BE CUSTOMIZED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF COMPLEX APPLICATIONS IN BIOTECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT, ENZYME DESIGN AND DRUG DISCOVERY. A ROBUST ENDPOINT BOOK-ENDING APPROACH THAT LEVERAGES THE GPU-ACCELERATED CAPABILITY OF THE AMBER MOLECULAR DYNAMICS ENGINE IS USED TO REACH THESE GOALS. SPECIFICALLY, THE OPEN-SOURCE HIGH-PERFORMANCE SOFTWARE FOR FREE ENERGY SIMULATIONS IS DESIGNED FOR MULTI-LAYERED HYBRID POTENTIALS USING COMBINATIONS OF LINEAR-SCALING MANY-BODY QUANTUM MECHANICAL METHODS VIA THE GPU-ACCELERATED QUICK PACKAGE, SCALABLE REACTIVE REAXFF FORCE FIELDS VIA THE PUREMD PACKAGE, AS WELL AS THE RECENTLY DEVELOPED DEEPMD-SE, ANAKIN-ME (ANI) AND AP-NET FAMILIES OF MACHINE LEARNING POTENTIALS. THE CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE IS BUILT UPON THE EXISTING HIGH-PERFORMANCE CUDA MD ENGINE IN AMBER AND EXTENDS IT TO A BROAD RANGE OF GPU-ACCELERATED ARCHITECTURES USING INDUSTRY-STANDARD PROGRAMMING MODELS. SCALABILITY IS ENSURED USING INNOVATIVE PARALLEL ALGORITHMS. HIGH IMPACT IS ACHIEVED BY LEVERAGING AMBER'S BROAD USER BASE TO EXPAND THE SCOPE AND SUCCESS OF FE APPLICATIONS. IN THIS WAY, THE PROJECT LEVERAGES EXISTING RECOGNIZED CAPABILITIES AND ACTIVELY ENGAGES A DIVERSE TEAM OF COLLABORATORS AND THE BROADER MOLECULAR SIMULATIONS COMMUNITY. THE CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE DELIVERED BY THE PROJECT ENABLES A WIDE RANGE OF NEW AND ENHANCED APPLICATIONS FOR A BROAD COMMUNITY OF USERS IN ACADEMIA, INDUSTRY, AND NATIONAL LABORATORIES. THESE APPLICATIONS INCLUDE DRUG DISCOVERY, ENZYME CATALYSIS, AND BIOMATERIALS DESIGN. THE AMBER SUITE OF PROGRAMS HAS A LONG-STANDING EXTENSIVE WORLDWIDE USERBASE, AND IS WIDELY USED ON NATIONAL PRODUCTION CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE. THE ENHANCEMENT OF AMBER AS AN ESTABLISHED, PROVEN SUSTAINABLE, AND WIDELY USED PACKAGE WILL ENSURE THAT THE SOFTWARE HAS A BROAD IMPACT WELL BEYOND THE END OF THE PROJECT. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO TRAIN A DIVERSE POPULATION OF STUDENTS AND RESEARCHERS IN THEORY, PROGRAMMING, COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY/BIOLOGY, COMPUTER SCIENCE, SCIENTIFIC WRITING, AND COMMUNICATION.

MAJOR ADVANCES IN PLANETARY SCIENCE CAN THUS BE DRIVEN BY ABSOLUTE GEOCHRONOLOGY IN THE NEXT DECADE  CALIBRATING BODY-SPECIFIC CHRONOLOGIES AND CREATING A FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING SOLAR SYSTEM FORMATION  THE EFFECTS OF IMPACT BOMBARDMENT ON LIFE  AND THE EVOLUTION OF PLANETS AND INTERIORS. ABSOLUTE AGES FOR MULTIPLE WORLDS ARE A DESIRE IN BOTH THE 2003 AND 2013 PLANETARY SCIENCE DECADAL SURVEYS  BUT IN THESE TWO DECADES  ONLY SAMPLE RETURN WAS CONSIDERED A VIABLE METHOD FOR GEO-CHRONOLOGY. THE DECADAL SURVEYS RECOMMENDED MISSION LISTS REFLECT THE REALITY FOR THOSE DECADES THAT SAMPLE RETURN IS THE ONLY WAY TO YIELD RELIABLE AND INTERPRETABLE GEOCHRONOLOGY. IN THE LAST TWO DECADES  NASA HAS ALSO INVESTED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF IN SITU DATING TECHNIQUES  INCREASING THE TECHNOLOGY READINESS LEVELS OF INSTRUMENTS USING COMPLEMENTARY RADIOGENIC ISOTOPIC SYSTEMS (K-AR AND RB-SR) TO TRL 6. THE TIME IS RIGHT TO CONSIDER HOW THE PRECISION ACHIEVABLE WITH IN SITU GEOCHRONOLOGY CAN ADVANCE IMPORTANT SCIENCE GOALS FOR THE NEXT DECADAL SURVEY  THE MOST FRUITFUL WAY TO DEPLOY THEM IN MISSIONS TO KEY PLANETARY DESTINATIONS  AND TO CONSIDER HOW THESE TECHNOLOGIES COMPLEMENT SAMPLE-RETURN EFFORTS FOR THE MOON AND MARS. FOR THIS PLANETARY MISSION CONCEPT STUDY  WE WILL FORMULATE AND COST A MEDIUM- OR FLAG-SHIP-CLASS MISSION FOR SOLAR SYSTEM CHRONOLOGY. THE AIM OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO GIVE THE NEXT DECADAL SURVEY PANEL A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE OR ADDITION TO SAMPLE RETURN MISSIONS TO ACCOMPLISH LONGSTANDING GEOCHRONOLOGY GOALS WITHIN A NEW FRONTIERS ENVELOPE. OUR SCIENCE DEFINITION TEAM (SDT) HAS EXPERTISE ACROSS THE MOON  MARS  AND SMALL BODIES COMMUNITIES TO IDENTIFY THE MOST IMPORTANT SCIENCE QUESTIONS THAT CAN BE ANSWERED IN THE NEXT DECADE USING THE FIRST GENERATION OF IN SITU DATING TECHNIQUES AND EXAMINE MISSION-LEVEL REQUIREMENTS  TRADES  AND INSTRUMENTATION FOR ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS. BY CONDUCTING THIS STUDY  WE WILL PROVIDE THE NEXT DECADAL SURVEY PANEL WITH SEVERAL OPTIONS FOR HOW GEOCHRONOLOGY MIGHT BE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE INNER SOLAR SYSTEM WITHIN THE PLANETARY SCIENCE PORTFOLIO  THE SYNERGIES THESE MEASUREMENTS HAVE WITH OTHER HIGH-PRIORITY SCIENCE GOALS  AND THE TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT SUCH MISSIONS.,NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,M,NONPROFIT WITH 501C3 IRS STATUS (OTHER THAN AN INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION),2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_80NSSC20K0373_8000/,2021-07-06 21:51:06.419231+00

THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS ARE SUBSTANTIAL SINCE ALMOST HALF OF MARITIME SHIPPING OPERATING COSTS ARE RELATED TO FUEL CONSUMPTION. THE EXPECTED OUTCOME OF THIS PROJECT IS A TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL BE RETROFITTED TO EXISTING SHIPPING FLEETS TO INCREASE FUEL EFFICIENCY WHILE DECREASING ENVIRONMENTALLY HARMFUL EMISSIONS. THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO IMPROVE THERMAL EFFICIENCY OF FUEL DISTILLATES, RANGING FROM DIESEL TO HEAVY FUEL OIL, BY USING WATER IN FUEL EMULSIONS.

CALVING FRONT) CHANGE FOR GREENLAND THROUGH DEVELOPMENT OF A SEMI-AUTOMATED TERMINUS PICKER FOR USE WITH THE LANDSAT MULTISPECTRAL IMAGERY ARCHIVE. IN OBSERVING HOW THE POSITION AND SHAPE OF THE TERMINUS CHANGE THROUGH TIME  WE WILL GAIN UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROCESSES THAT MAY BE INFLUENCING THE MASS BALANCE OF THE ICE SHEET. NO COMPLETE ARCHIVE OF TERMINUS POSITIONS EXIST AND USUALLY ONLY A FEW PICKS ARE USED TO REPRESENT GLACIER CHANGES. THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO DEVELOP A SEMI-AUTOMATED TERMINUS PICKER TO DETERMINE THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL PATTERN OF GLACIER TERMINUS CHANGE FOR ALL OF THE GREENLAND MARINE-TERMINATING GLACIERS AND DEVELOP THIS ARCHIVE. THE TERMINUS POSITIONS WILL BE OBTAINED BY USING IMAGE SEGMENTATION AND EDGE DETECTION ALGORITHMS THAT ENABLE THE CLASSIFICATION OF LAND SURFACES AT THE LEVEL OF DETAIL NEEDED FOR POLAR APPLICATIONS (IN PARTICULAR DELINEATING BETWEEN ICEBERG MELANGE AND CREVASSED GLACIER ICE). THE NASA LANDSAT MISSIONS HAVE PROVIDED A RECORD OF FREE  CONTINUOUS  MULTISPECTRAL SATELLITE IMAGERY SINCE THE 1970'S WITH 16-18 DAY TEMPORAL RESOLUTION AND THUS CAN PROVIDE A ROBUST RECORD OF TERMINUS POSITION THROUGH TIME. USING GOOGLE EARTH ENGINE  A CLOUD-BASED PLATFORM FOR GEOSPATIAL ANALYSIS  AND LANDSAT IMAGERY  WE WILL CLASSIFY IMAGES OF CALVING FRONTS INTO DIFFERENT CLASSES BASED ON SHARED CHARACTERISTICS AND CREATE MASKS FOR EACH IMAGE THAT ARE LABELED WITH TERRAIN TYPE. EDGE-DETECTION ALGORITHMS WILL THEN EXTRACT OUT THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN ICE AND WATER OR ICE AND MELANGE TO ENABLE TERMINUS IDENTIFICATION WITHIN MASKED REGIONS. THIS PROCESS IS RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD FOR REGIONS WHERE THE ICE/OCEAN BOUNDARY IS SIMPLE  HOWEVER WE WILL ALSO APPLY IT TO MORE COMPLEX SCENES (E.G. ICE MELANGE PRESENCE  LOW SOLAR ILLUMINATION) BY EXPLOITING TEXTURAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TERRAIN TYPES. ONCE COMPLETE  THE TERMINUS DATA FOR GREENLAND OUTLET GLACIERS WILL BE COMPARED TO OTHER NASA-FUNDED DATASETS  SUCH AS OPERATION ICEBRIDGE AND OCEANS MELTING GREENLAND BATHYMETRY CONSTRAINED BED TOPOGRAPHY AND ICESAT-2 AND THE POLAR GEOSPATIAL CENTER'S DIGITALGLOBE DIGITAL ELEVATION MODELS. WE PLAN TO EXAMINE RETREAT RATES AND BED GEOMETRY FOR ALL OUTLET GLACIERS AND ANALYZE INDIVIDUAL AND REGIONAL GLACIER BEHAVIOR TO PRODUCE THE MOST COMPLETE ARCHIVE OF GLACIER CHANGES FOR THE ICE SHEET. BY BUILDING A COMPLETE RECORD OF TERMINUS CHANGE IN GREENLAND WE CAN INVESTIGATE THE CONTROLS ON CALVING RETREAT AND LONG-TERM CHANGES IN TERMINUS POSITION THAT OCCUR.

WHILE MOST OF THE LITERATURE HAS FOCUSED ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES REGARDING CRIME PREVENTION, LAW ENFORCEMENT PRIMARILY USES SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES TO RESOLVE CRIME CASES (DOWLING ET AL., 2019). THE STUDY OF SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES FOR IMPROVING CLEARANCE RATES IS AN EMERGING LITERATURE IDENTIFYING SOME AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT SUCH AS INCREASING VIDEO QUALITY, IMPROVING VIDEO COVERAGE, AND REDUCING THE NUMBER OF HOURS SPENT SURVEILLING CAMERAS BY ENHANCING VIDEO ANALYTICS (LA VIGNE ET AL., 2011; SHUKLA, LAWRENCE, & PETERSON, 2020). WITH RURAL POLICING DEPARTMENTS OFTEN BEING UNDERFUNDED AND UNDERSTAFFED (LA VIGNE ET AL., 2011), WE PROPOSE TO IMPROVE VIDEO ANALYTICS THROUGH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.

TO BUILD THE AVAST, WE WILL DEVELOP A SYSTEM TO CONVERT IMAGES FROM VIDEO AT REGULAR INTERVALS AND CREATE AUTOMATED ANNOTATIONS OF THESE IMAGES USING COMPUTER VISION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE METHODS. FURTHER ANNOTATIONS WILL THEN BE ADDED BY SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS, AND THE SYSTEM WILL BE RETRAINED BASED ON ADDED INFORMATION. THE ANNOTATIONS AND THEIR ASSOCIATIONS TO VIDEOS WILL BE STORED IN A DATABASE THAT CAN BE RETRIEVED VIA A SEARCH ENGINE THAT WILL BE DESIGNED FOR USE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL. TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE AVAST, WE WILL CREATE PRE- AND POST- TEST SURVEYS, CONDUCT SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS, AND CONDUCT USABILITY TESTING USING THINK-ALOUD TECHNIQUES.

THE PROPERTIES THAT MAKE SIC DESIRABLE FOR THESE APPLICATIONS INCLUDE ITS LOW ACTIVATION WHEN SUBJECTED TO NEUTRON IRRADIATION, ITS ABILITY TO RETAIN STRENGTH AND STIFFNESS AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES ALONG WITH ITS OUTSTANDING RESISTANCE TO OXIDATION, CREEP DEFORMATION AND ABRASION. ITS LOW COEFFICIENT OF THERMAL EXPANSION AND ITS HIGH THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY MAKE SIC RESISTANT TO THERMAL SHOCK. THE RELATIVELY LOW FRACTURE TOUGHNESS OF SIC HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESSED BY ADDING REINFORCING FIBERS AND BY ENGINEERING THE FIBER/MATRIX INTERFACE, WHICH RENDER TOUGH, DAMAGE-TOLERANT STRUCTURES THAT EXHIBIT NON-CATASTROPHIC, GRACEFUL MODES OF FAILURE TO THE POINT THAT THEY HAVE REPLACED METALLIC COMPONENTS IN AIRCRAFT ENGINES. THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY UTILIZES AN ADVANCED ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING MACHINE AND METHOD TO FABRICATE COMPLEX SIC COMPONENTS AND INCORPORATE CHOPPED FIBERS TO ENABLE COMPOSITE PROPERTIES. NO COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE PRODUCTION PROCESS EXISTS THAT CAN FABRICATE COMPLEX SIC COMPONENTS OF THE SCALE, COST, PERFORMANCE, AND RELIABILITY THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE REQUIRED FOR A BROAD RANGE OF HEAT EXCHANGERS OPERATING IN HARSH ENVIRONMENTS. THEREFORE, THIS PROJECT HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPACT BOTH FOR THE ENERGY SECTOR AS WELL AS U.S. ADVANCED MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES OVERALL.

BUILDING TURBULENT AND CHEMICAL MODELS THAT MAKE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS WITH KNOWN UNCERTAINTY ARE CRUCIAL TO ENABLE THE DESIGN OF CLEANER AND BETTER ENGINES AS WELL AS THE PREDICTION OF DISASTROUS FIRE RISKS TO MEET THE URGENT NEED FOR GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY. ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES IN QUANTIFYING THE UNCERTAINTY FOR TURBULENT COMBUSTION SIMULATIONS IS THE COMPUTATIONAL COST ASSOCIATED WITH COMPLEX CHEMISTRY, WHERE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PARAMETERS ARE INVOLVED. THUS, IT IS CURRENTLY IMPOSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE THE UNCERTAINTY FOR EACH PARAMETER AND TO PREDICT THE EFFECTS ON TURBULENT COMBUSTION SIMULATIONS. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO ESTABLISH A THEORETICAL FOUNDATION AND DEVELOP A COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE OPEN-SOURCE PACKAGES IN THE PROJECT WILL ENGAGE A BROAD COMMUNITY AND PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS IN THE SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS (STEM) FIELDS. THE CURRENT PROJECT AIMS AT ADDRESSING TWO TECHNICAL QUESTIONS: FIRST, HOW TO QUANTIFY THE KINETIC UNCERTAINTY IN TURBULENT COMBUSTION SIMULATIONS TO EVALUATE THE SOUNDNESS AND GUIDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF TURBULENT COMBUSTION MODELS; AND SECOND, HOW TO LEVERAGE EXPERIMENTS NOT ONLY TO VALIDATE BUT ALSO INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHEMICAL MODELS. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL VALIDATE THE HYPOTHESIS OF UNIVERSAL KINETIC SENSITIVITY DIRECTION IN LAMINAR AND TURBULENT FLAMES TO BUILD THE THEORETICAL FOUNDATION FOR REDUCING THE DIMENSIONALITY OF THE UNCERTAIN KINETIC PARAMETER SPACE VIA THE ACTIVE SUBSPACE METHOD. FURTHERMORE, A COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORK AND OPEN-SOURCE PACKAGES WILL BE DEVELOPED, COMBINING PHYSICS-INFORMED ACTIVE SUBSPACE ESTIMATION, AUTO-DIFFERENTIABLE PROGRAMMING, AND GPU ACCELERATION, TO ENABLE THE FORWARD AND INVERSE UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION IN LARGE-SCALE COMBUSTION SIMULATIONS WITH AFFORDABLE COMPUTATIONAL COST. THE FRAMEWORK WILL BE ADOPTED TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY TO 1) CONSTRAIN KINETIC UNCERTAINTIES BASED ON CANONICAL COMBUSTION MEASUREMENTS, AND 2) QUANTIFY THE EFFECT OF KINETIC UNCERTAINTIES ON LAMINAR AND TURBULENT FLAME RESPONSES. THE SUCCESS OF THE PROJECT WILL PROVIDE FUNDAMENTAL INSIGHTS ON THE IMPACT OF FLOW-CHEMISTRY INTERACTION ON THE PROPAGATION OF KINETIC UNCERTAINTY AND ENABLE EFFICIENT AND TRACTABLE UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION IN PRACTICAL COMBUSTION SYSTEMS AND PHENOMENA WITH REAL FUELS.

MUCH PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN REVEALING THE GENETIC ARCHITECTURE OF AD AND ITS COMMON ANTECEDENT, MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT (MCI). YET, SOME PEOPLE WHO INCUR EXCESSIVE AD RISK REMAIN COGNITIVELY NORMAL. IDENTIFYING RISK FACTORS FOR COGNITIVE DETERIORATION IN DEMENTIA CAN GUIDE NOVEL INVESTIGATIONS INTO MECHANISMS UNDERLYING RESILIENCE TO AD. THE BEST-AVAILABLE POLYGENIC RISK SCORE FOR AD EXPLAINS 1.7% OF OVERALL LIABILITY INDEPENDENT FROM THE LEADING RISK GENE, APOE (ACCOUNTS FOR 17.4% OF THE VARIANCE IN AD), INDICATING THAT A MASSIVE PORTION OF GENETIC LIABILITY REMAINS UNRESOLVED. GENETIC RISK FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE CONTRIBUTES ADDITIONAL RISK FOR AD, THUS A SYSTEMS-LEVEL INVESTIGATION INTO HOW CARDIOVASCULAR DYSFUNCTION INTERACTS WITH NEUROBIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS OF COGNITIVE DECLINE IS WARRANTED. TOWARD THIS END, WE DEVELOPED A TRANSCRIPTOME-IMPUTATION METHOD—THE BRAIN GENE EXPRESSION AND NETWORK IMPUTATION ENGINE (BRAINGENIE)—TO MEASURE THE BRAIN TRANSCRIPTOME IN LIVING INDIVIDUALS USING BLOOD-BASED GENE-EXPRESSION PROFILES. BRAINGENIE IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER TRANSCRIPTOME-IMPUTATION METHODS, AND CAPTURES A MUCH LARGER PROPORTION OF THE VARIANCE IN THE BRAIN TRANSCRIPTOME. BRAINGENIE CAN PREDICT 9–57% OF THE BRAIN TRANSCRIPTOME, YIELDING AN APPROXIMATE 1.8-FOLD INCREASE IN COVERAGE RELATIVE TO THE PRIOR “GOLD STANDARD” METHOD PREDIXCAN, AND WHICH GREATLY IMPROVES OUR STATISTICAL POWER TO DETECT GENES AND PATHWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH DISEASE. WE HAVE ALSO GENERALIZED OUR BRAINGENIE FRAMEWORK TO IMPUTE CARDIAC-SPECIFIC TRANSCRIPTOME PROFILES (HEARTGENIE), THEREBY ALLOWING US TO INVESTIGATE BRAIN- AND CARDIAC-SPECIFIC TRANSCRIPTOME SIGNATURES ASSOCIATED WITH COGNITIVE DETERIORATION IN DEMENTIA.

BY  NEAR-REAL-TIME  WE MEAN REPEATING ANALYSES AS OFTEN THE UNDERLYING SATELLITE OR FIELD DATA CHANGE. OUR PROPOSAL FOCUSES ON TIGERS (PANTHERA TIGRIS) AS AN EXAMPLE  IMPLEMENTING WELL-ESTABLISHED MODELS ON A CLOUD-BASED GEOSPATIAL COMPUTING PLATFORM (E.G. GOOGLE EARTH ENGINE) AND SERVING DATA BY WEB PORTAL. WE PROPOSE TO COMPUTE INTEGRATIVE MODELS OF TIGER CONSERVATION LANDSCAPES (TCLS; DINERSTEIN ET AL. 2007  SANDERSON ET AL. 2006) AND SOURCE SITES (SSS; WALSTON ET AL. 2010) IN TIME SERIES AND ANALYZE THESE CRITICAL SITES IN RELATION TO PROTECTED AREAS AND ECOSYSTEMS ON A COUNTRY-BY-COUNTRY BASIS  LOOKING BACK TO THE YEAR 2000 AND FORWARD THROUGH AT LEAST 2030. WE WILL ALSO COMPUTE NEW 1 KM2 RESOLUTION HUMAN FOOTPRINT MAPS (SENSU SANDERSON ET AL. 2002; SEE VENTER ET AL. 2016) ON AN ANNUAL BASIS GLOBALLY. WHAT TIGERS NEED IS ANALOGOUS TO WHAT MANY WILDLIFE SPECIES NEED: INTACT PATCHES OF ECOSYSTEMS WITH SUITABLE STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS OF ECOSYSTEMS  SOME OF WHICH ARE REMOTELY SENSIBLE; FREEDOM FROM TOO MUCH HUMAN INFLUENCE  AS MEASURED BY THE HUMAN FOOTPRINT; AND INTERCONNECTED BLOCKS OF UNDIMINISHED HABITAT LARGE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT A POPULATION. CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ALL THESE FACTORS  AND NEW SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS SUCH AS THE FIRE INFORMATION FOR RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (FIRMS) AND ANNUALIZED LAND COVER PRODUCTS FROM MODIS ALLOW US TO DETECT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS. STRUCTURED IF ASYNCHRONOUS FIELD DATA COLLECTIONS ACROSS 10 COUNTRIES IN ASIA WILL ENABLE US TO CALIBRATE MODELS  GENERATE UP-TO-DATE FINDINGS  AND VALIDATE THE RESULTS. COUNTRIES NEED TIME-SERIES  NOT SNAPSHOTS  TO SHOW CHANGE AND RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO THEIR INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS AND NATIONAL GOALS. HERE THEY WILL RECEIVE THEM WHENEVER OBSERVATIONS CHANGE THROUGH THEIR INTERNET BROWSER  AS BOTH TOP-LEVEL INDICATORS (E.G.

IN A REAL-TIME SYSTEM, PROGRAMS EXIST THAT ARE SUBJECT TO TIMING CONSTRAINTS. AN AUTOMOBILE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE: WHEN A CAR'S BRAKE PEDAL IS DEPRESSED, THE BRAKING SYSTEM MUST REACT BY A CERTAIN DEADLINE. MANY REAL-TIME SYSTEMS ARE SAFETY-CRITICAL, MEANING THAT FAILURES MAY HAVE CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES, SUCH AS LOSS OF LIFE OR SERIOUS FINANCIAL REPERCUSSIONS. AUTOMOBILES ARE ALSO A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A SAFETY-CRITICAL SYSTEM; WHILE A TYPICAL DRIVER MAY BE UNAWARE OF IT, MODERN CARS CONTAIN MANY COMPUTERS THAT RUN A MYRIAD OF PROGRAMS THAT PERFORM FUNCTIONS REQUIRED FOR STEERING, BRAKING, ENGINE CONTROL, ETC. SAFETY-CRITICAL REAL-TIME SYSTEMS TYPICALLY MUST UNDERGO A CERTIFICATION PROCESS THAT ENSURES THAT IMPORTANT FUNCTIONALITY IS PROPERLY SUPPORTED. AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS PROCESS IS TO VALIDATE THAT DEADLINE REQUIREMENTS ARE MET, I.E., THAT PROGRAMS EXECUTE ON TIME. TO DO THIS, WORST-CASE EXECUTION TIMES (WCETS) OF PROGRAMS SHOULD BE KNOWN. UNFORTUNATELY, ON TODAY'S COMPLEX MULTICORE COMPUTERS, DETERMINING ACCURATE WCETS IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE WORST-CASE EXECUTION TIME OF A PROGRAM MAY OCCUR UNDER RARE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THUS BE DIFFICULT TO REPRODUCE. THE TRADITIONAL DEFENSE AGAINST NOT KNOWING WCETS WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY IS TO HAVE THE OPERATING SYSTEM (OS) ENFORCE EXECUTION BUDGETS; A PROGRAM'S BUDGET IS A LIMIT ON ITS EXECUTION TIME THAT THE OS ENSURES WON'T BE EXCEEDED. WHILE BUDGETS HAVE CONVENTIONALLY BEEN ENFORCED AT THE PROGRAM LEVEL, IN CHALLENGING REAL-TIME APPLICATIONS OF INTEREST TODAY, SUCH ENFORCEMENT IS NEEDED AT MANY LEVELS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN AN AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE, THE OVERALL SYSTEM IS BROKEN INTO SUBSYSTEMS, WHERE EACH SUBSYSTEM PROVIDES SOME SEPARATE FUNCTION, E.G., SENSING OBSTACLES IN THE ROAD, COMPUTING A PLAN TO REACT TO OBSTACLES, ETC. THESE SUBSYSTEMS, WHICH MAY CONTAIN MANY PROGRAMS EACH, SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO BUDGET ENFORCEMENT AS WELL. FOR INSTANCE, IF THE OBSTACLE-SENSING SUBSYSTEM TAKES TOO MUCH TIME, THEN EXECUTING THE PLANNING SUBSYSTEM IS POINTLESS. THIS PROJECT IS DIRECTED AT (I) IDENTIFYING THE VARIOUS LEVELS AT WHICH BUDGETS MUST BE ENFORCED IN COMPLEX MULTICORE REAL-TIME APPLICATIONS, (II) EXAMINING THE IMPLICATIONS FOR REAL-TIME SAFETY CERTIFICATION THAT ARISE FROM MAKING MULTI-LEVEL BUDGET ENFORCEMENT A FIRST-CLASS CONCERN, AND (III) PRODUCING EFFICIENT IMPLEMENTATIONS OF SUCH ENFORCEMENT. ADDRESSING THESE GOALS WILL ENABLE SAFER SYSTEMS TO BE DEVELOPED. IN TERMS OF BROADER IMPACTS, A SPECIAL EMPHASIS WILL BE PLACED ON OUTREACH TO GIRLS AND WOMEN. SUCH OUTREACH WILL INCLUDE: EVENTS INVOLVING THE GRADUATE WOMEN IN COMPUTER SCIENCE (GWICS) GROUP AT UNC, WHICH HOSTS AN ANNUAL RESEARCH SYMPOSIUM TARGETED TOWARD UNDERGRADUATE WOMEN AND OTHER UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES; TAR HEEL HACK, A HACKATHON FOR LOCAL MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS; UNC COMPUTER SCIENCE'S GIRLS WHO CODE CLUB, WHICH PROVIDES LOCAL GIRLS IN GRADES 6-12 WITH A COMMUNITY FOR LEARNING ABOUT COMPUTER SCIENCE; AND UNC COMPUTER SCIENCE'S ANNUAL OPEN HOUSE AND SCIENCE EXPO.

THE SHEER NUMBER OF POTENTIALLY RELEVANT ARTICLES THAT MUST BE EXAMINED DURING THIS PROCESS POSES A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE IN ENSURING THE ACCURACY AND REPRODUCIBILITY OF CLINICAL INTERPRETATION AS IT IS TIME-CONSUMING, ERROR-PRONE, AND HIGHLY USER-DEPENDENT. TO THIS END, WE HAVE DEVELOPED THE MASTERMIND GENOMIC SEARCH ENGINE - A COMMERCIAL DATABASE THAT AUTOMATICALLY ORGANIZES DISEASE, GENE AND VARIANT INFORMATION FROM THE MEDICAL LITERATURE BY SYSTEMATICALLY INDEXING MILLIONS OF SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES. MASTERMIND IS USED BY OVER 9,100 VARIANT SCIENTISTS IN MORE THAN 100 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES TO MORE QUICKLY INTERPRET GENETIC VARIANTS IN CLINICAL SETTINGS. IN PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT, WE DEVELOPED AND TESTED A MICROPUBLICATION PLATFORM WITHIN MASTERMIND THAT ASSEMBLES LITERATURE CURATION ALONG WITH POPULATION FREQUENCY DATA, COMPUTATIONAL PREDICTIONS OF PATHOGENICITY, AND AUTOMATED ACMG/AMP CLASSIFICATIONS THAT IMPROVES THE SPEED OF VARIANT INTERPRETATION BY MORE THAN 70% AND INCREASES THE SENSITIVITY OF THESE RESULTS BY 2-20X. THE PRESENT PROPOSAL SEEKS TO BUILD ON THE SUCCESS OF PHASE I BY 1) INTEGRATING THE MICROPUBLICATION PLATFORM INTO MASTERMIND WITH MIGRATION OF COLLABORATIVE FEATURES FOR COMMUNITY-BASED EVALUATION OF VARIANT INTERPRETATIONS; 2) OPTIMIZING AND IMPROVING AUTOMATED VARIANT INTERPRETATION/PRIORITIZATION OF ARTICLES AND IMPLEMENTING A RIGOROUS QUALITY ASSURANCE PROCESS; AND 3) USING THESE IMPROVEMENTS TO CURATE ALL EVIDENCE IN ALL VARIANTS IN ALL GENES COMPRISING THE ENTIRE HUMAN GENOME, BEGINNING WITH THE CLINICAL EXOME. INTEGRATION OF THE PRE-CURATED GENOME DATA IN THE MICROPUBLICATION PLATFORM WILL RESULT IN MASTERMIND ENTERPRISE, ALLOWING FOR IMMEDIATE AND ACCURATE GENOME-WIDE VARIANT INTERPRETATIONS WITH COLLABORATIVE CURATION IN REAL-TIME AT THE POINT OF INTERACTION WITH SOURCE MATERIAL (I.E. INDIVIDUAL REFERENCES). THIS WORK WILL MITIGATE REPRODUCIBILITY CHALLENGES PLAGUING OTHER LARGE-SCALE CROWD-SOURCED PROJECTS, INCLUDING THOSE UNDERTAKEN BY GROUPS LIKE NIH’S CLINVAR AND QIAGEN’S HGMD. IN ADDITION, OUR NOVEL APPROACH WILL NOT SUFFER FROM POOR SENSITIVITY AS IT RELIES ON A COMPREHENSIVE SOURCE OF MEDICAL LITERATURE PRE-ANNOTATED BASED ON GENETIC CONTENT. THIS WORK WILL PERMIT DRAMATIC SCALING OF VARIANT INTERPRETATION ACTIVITIES AND ALLOW FOR COMPLETE AND ACCURATE CURATION OF THE ENTIRE HUMAN GENOME WITHIN 2 YEARS – A FEAT THAT COULD NOT BE COMPLETED UTILIZING CURRENT MANUAL METHODS FOR VARIANT INTERPRETATION. MASTERMIND ENTERPRISE WILL BE REVOLUTIONARY IN THE GENOMICS INDUSTRY AND WILL REPRESENT A NATURAL NEXT STEP TO BUILD ON THE ACHIEVEMENTS PROVIDED BY THE HUMAN GENOME PROJECT AND THE REDUCED COST OF NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING. IT WILL SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVE DIAGNOSTIC RATES AND ACCURACY IN THE CLINIC, ESPECIALLY IN RARE DISEASE, WHERE A LACK OF GENETIC EVIDENCE OFTEN RESULTS IN SEVERELY DELAYED AND INACCURATE DIAGNOSES. ADDITIONALLY, IT WILL ALLOW THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY TO DEVELOP MORE SUCCESSFUL TARGETED THERAPIES AND TO DESIGN MORE INCLUSIVE CLINICAL TRIALS AS WELL AS TO MORE RELIABLY IDENTIFY PATIENTS WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION.

BY DEPLOYING A DEVICE TO INCREASE THE SURFACE AREA OF A SATELLITE  THE AERODYNAMIC DRAG FORCE WILL BE GREATER AND THE MAXIMUM ALTITUDE FOR DE-ORBIT WITHIN 25 YEARS WILL BE HIGHER. ADDITIONALLY  FOR SPACECRAFT CONTAINING COMPONENTS THAT DO NOT DISINTEGRATE ON RE-ENTRY  THE ONLY WAY TO OBTAIN A LAUNCH IS TO FIND SOME MEANS OF CONTROLLING THE DE-ORBIT LOCATION SUCH THAT THE RISK OF A PERSON BEING STRUCK BY FALLING DEBRIS IS LESS THAN 1 IN 10 000. THE FIRST COMPONENT OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH INVOLVES THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ALGORITHM TO CONTROL THE DE-ORBIT LOCATION OF A LOW EARTH ORBIT SPACECRAFT BY MODULATING THE SPACECRAFT S BALLISTIC COEFFICIENT. THIS ALGORITHM COULD BE UTILIZED TO CONTROL THE DE-ORBIT LOCATION OF ANY SPACE VEHICLE CAPABLE OF VARYING ITS CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA EITHER THROUGH CHANGES IN ATTITUDE OR THE DEPLOYMENT OF A DRAG DEVICE. ULTIMATELY  THIS WILL ENABLE SPACECRAFT WITHOUT THRUSTERS TO TARGET A DE-ORBIT POINT AWAY FROM POPULATED AREAS AND WILL ENABLE VEHICLES WITH THRUSTERS (SUCH AS ROCKET UPPER STAGES) TO SAVE FUEL BY LEVERAGING THE AVAILABLE AERODYNAMIC DRAG TO TARGET A DE-ORBIT LOCATION INSTEAD OF PERFORMING A DE-ORBIT BURN. THE MAJORITY OF THE GUIDANCE GENERATION PORTION OF THIS TARGETING ALGORITHM HAS ALREADY BEEN DEVELOPED AND WAS BASED ON AN ANALYTICAL SOLUTION RELATING THE SPACECRAFT INITIAL CONDITIONS AND BALLISTIC COEFFICIENT PROFILE TO THE DEORBIT LOCATION. USING THIS ANALYTICAL SOLUTION ALONG WITH AN ITERATIVE NUMERICAL PROCEDURE  IT IS POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE DRAG PROFILE NECESSARY TO DE-ORBIT IN A DESIRED LOCATION. THE GUIDANCE TRACKING PORTION OF THE TARGETING ALGORITHM THAT WILL MODULATE THE SATELLITE S BALLISTIC COEFFICIENT TO MAINTAIN THE DESIRED DECAY TRAJECTORY (GUIDANCE) IS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT BUT INITIAL SIMULATION RESULTS WITH A SIMPLE PID CONTROL LAW INDICATE THAT PERFORMANCE WILL BE SATISFACTORY. MODEL REFERENCE ADAPTIVE CONTROL TECHNIQUES WILL BE UTILIZED IN FUTURE VERSIONS OF THE GUIDANCE TRACKING ALGORITHM TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE IN THE FACE OF DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THE ACTUAL AND ESTIMATED DRAG FORCE. THE SECOND COMPONENT OF THIS PROJECT INVOLVES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A RETRACTABLE CUBESAT DRAG DEVICE THAT IS CAPABLE OF DE-ORBITING A 15 KG SATELLITE FROM A 700 KM CIRCULAR ORBIT IN 25 YEARS AND CAN BE USED TO ACTIVELY MODULATE THE SPACECRAFT S BALLISTIC COEFFICIENT FOR AERODYNAMIC ORBIT CONTROL AND TARGETED RE-ENTRY. THIS DEVICE WILL CONSIST OF FOUR MEASURING-TAPE-STYLE BOOMS INCLINED AT 20 DEGREES RELATIVE TO THE REAR FACE OF THE SATELLITE. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING A MEANS OF MODULATING THE BALLISTIC COEFFICIENT  THE DART CONFIGURATION OF THE DRAG DEVICE WILL MAKE THE SATELLITE AERODYNAMICALLY STABILIZE IN THE RAM-DIRECTION. FURTHERMORE  PARTIALLY RETRACTING TWO OF THE BOOMS OPPOSITE EACH OTHER WILL RESULT IN A CLEAR MINIMUM MOMENT OF INERTIA AXIS WHICH WILL NATURALLY ALIGN WITH THE NADIR VECTOR DUE TO GRAVITY GRADIENT TORQUES. THE DRAG DEVICE WILL ULTIMATELY PROVIDE 3-AXIS ATTITUDE STABILIZATION AS WELL AS ORBITAL MANEUVERING CAPABILITIES USING AERODYNAMIC AND GRAVITY GRADIENT EFFECTS  POTENTIALLY ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR PROPULSION OR ATTITUDE CONTROL SYSTEMS ON MANY SATELLITES. ADDITIONALLY  THE ENTIRETY OF THE GUIDANCE GENERATION AND GUIDANCE TRACKING ALGORITHMS WILL BE CONDUCTED ON A MICROPROCESSOR LOCATED INSIDE THE DRAG DEVICE. THIS WILL MINIMIZE GROUND OPERATOR WORKLOAD BUT WILL DEMAND ROBUST AND EFFICIENT ALGORITHMS CAPABLE OF RUNNING ON A PLATFORM WITH LIMITED COMPUTATIONAL POWER. THE TEAM PLANS TO LAUNCH A CUBESAT IN THE NEXT 2-3 YEARS TO TEST THE DRAG DEVICE AND TARGETING ALGORITHM. A SUCCESSFUL FLIGHT DEMONSTRATION WILL HOPEFULLY MAKE THE DRAG DEVICE AND DEORBIT POINT TARGETING ALGORITHM STANDARD TOOLS FOR ATTITUDE CONTROL  ORBIT CONTROL  AND ORBITAL DEBRIS MITIGATION.,NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,H,PUBLIC/STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_80NSSC17K0232_8000/,2020-10-05 15:28:30.531358+00

TODAY?S MAINSTREAM STATE-OF-THE-ART HIGH-TEMPERATURE SENSING SOLUTIONS INVOLVE MULTIPLE COMPONENTS DISTRIBUTED IN DISTANT ZONES AT VARIOUS TEMPERATURES AND CONNECTED VIA HIGH-TEMPERATURE CABLES OR FIBERS, RESULTING IN BULKY AND INEFFECTIVE SENSING SYSTEMS. MINIATURE HIGH-TEMPERATURE SENSORS ARE THUS HIGHLY DESIRABLE, TO PROVIDE REAL-TIME SENSING AND MONITORING CAPABILITIES IN SMALL FORM FACTOR, PARTICULARLY TOWARD FUTURE INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT) ADAPTABLE TO HARSH ENVIRONMENTS. TO DATE, INTEGRATED HIGH-TEMPERATURE (UP TO 1000?C) SENSORS REMAIN CHALLENGING DUE TO THE LACK OF DEVICE TECHNOLOGIES IN BOTH SENSING ELEMENTS AND INTERFACING CIRCUITS. IN ADDITION TO DEVELOPING A SUITABLE PLATFORM, FUNDAMENTAL STUDIES OF THE EFFECTS OF ~1000?C HIGH TEMPERATURE UPON DEVICES ARE GREATLY NEEDED. THIS PROJECT IS FOCUSED ON INNOVATING 1000?C-CAPABLE SENSORS BASED ON INTEGRATING GRAPHENE NANOELECTROMECHANICAL RESONATORS AND GRAPHENE ELECTRONICS, BY EXPLOITING THE INHERENT HIGH-TEMPERATURE DURABILITY AND UNIQUE COMBINATION OF THE ELECTRICAL, THERMAL, AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF GRAPHENE. THIS RESEARCH WILL LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR DEVELOPING ULTRACOMPACT, ULTRALOW-WEIGHT SENSORS THAT CAN OPERATE AT VERY HIGH TEMPERATURES AND IN HARSH ENVIRONMENTS, ESPECIALLY IN ENERGY AND AEROSPACE INDUSTRY, AND FOR ENVIRONMENT AND DISASTER MONITORING (E.G., TO ASSIST DRONES FOR FIGHTING WILDFIRES). FINDINGS IN THIS RESEARCH OF ATOMICALLY THIN CRYSTALS AND THEIR DEVICES WILL GENERATE FASCINATING EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING MATERIALS AND INSPIRATIONS FOR STUDENTS FROM K-12 THROUGH GRADUATE SCHOOL. THE PROJECT ALSO CREATES OPPORTUNITIES FOR BROADENING THE PARTICIPATION OF UNDERREPRESENTED AND ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGEOUS GROUPS, AND FOR PARTNERSHIP TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN ACADEMIA AND INDUSTRY IN SCALED MANUFACTURING. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO DESIGN, MODEL, FABRICATE, AND EXPERIMENTALLY DEMONSTRATE A NEW CLASS OF LOW-POWER RESONANT NANOELECTROMECHANICAL SENSORS FOR VERY HIGH OR EXTREME TEMPERATURE, AND HARSH-ENVIRONMENT APPLICATIONS WHERE TEMPERATURE OF INTEREST CAN EXCEED 1000?C. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL ACHIEVE THESE GOALS BY SYSTEMATICALLY INVESTIGATING ATOMICALLY THIN GRAPHENE TWO-DIMENSIONAL (2D) RESONANT NANOELECTROMECHANICAL TRANSDUCERS, 2D NANOELECTRONIC CIRCUITS, AND THEIR INTEGRATED SYSTEMS. BUILT ON UNDERSTANDING FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND LIMITATIONS IN STATE-OF-THE-ART DEVICES AND SYSTEMS, THIS PROJECT EXPLOITS MULTIPHYSICS COUPLING AMONG MECHANICAL, ELECTRICAL, AND THERMAL DOMAINS AT HIGH TEMPERATURE IN GRAPHENE RESONANT NANOELECTROMECHANICAL SYSTEMS (NEMS) PLATFORM, TO CARRY OUT EFFICIENT AND JUDICIOUS USE OF THE INTERNAL TRANSDUCTION EFFECTS THAT UNIQUELY EXIST IN HIGH-TEMPERATURE ENVIRONMENT, THANKS TO THE INHERENT HIGH-TEMPERATURE ENDURANCE OF GRAPHENE. SPECIFICALLY, THIS EAGER PROJECT WILL DEMONSTRATE GRAPHENE NEMS OSCILLATORS WITH REAL-TIME SENSING CAPABILITIES, BY CO-DESIGNING AND FABRICATING GRAPHENE NEMS AND GRAPHENE ELECTRONICS THAT ARE CHIP-TO-CHIP INTEGRATED USING HIGH-TEMPERATURE INTERCONNECTS. AFTER SUCCESSFUL CONSTRUCTION OF GRAPHENE OSCILLATORS, TEMPERATURE SENSING UP TO 1000?C OR EVEN HIGHER WILL BE DEMONSTRATED, TO VALIDATE SENSING FUNCTION OF THE GRAPHENE NEMS OSCILLATORS. THIS RESEARCH WILL ATTAIN NEW INNOVATIONS AND INSIGHTS IN DEVICE-CIRCUIT CO-DESIGN AND NANOSYSTEMS INTEGRATION, SINCE OTHERWISE HIGH-TEMPERATURE ENVIRONMENTS DETERIORATE SENSOR PERFORMANCE FOR NEARLY ALL CONVENTIONAL MATERIALS AND DEVICES. THE HETEROGENEOUS INTEGRATION OF THE GRAPHENE NEMS AND GRAPHENE ELECTRONICS WILL ENABLE NEXT-GENERATION HIGHLY DURABLE MINIATURIZED LOW-POWER SENSORS FOR HIGH-TEMPERATURE AND EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS.

THE PROJECT'S IMPACTS ARE TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR PROGRAMMERS TO WRITE SOFTWARE THAT IS MORE ROBUST, MORE SECURE, EASIER TO REASON ABOUT, AND WITH FEWER BUGS, EVEN IN APPLICATION ARENAS WHERE HIGH PERFORMANCE IS NECESSARY. THE PROJECT'S NOVELTIES ARE TWO: ITS USE OF AN ANNOTATED INTERMEDIATE REPRESENTATION, CALLED 3CPS, THAT ALLOWS FACTS DETERMINED BY PROGRAM ANALYSIS AND DECISIONS DETERMINED BY OPTIMIZATION POLICIES TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRAM'S REPRESENTATION; AND A SUITE OF HIGHER-ORDER CONTROL-FLOW ANALYSES DESIGNED TO DIRECT TRANSFORMATIONS ON PROGRAMS IN THE 3CPS FORM. THE GOAL OF THE WORK IS TO DEVELOP THE ARCHITECTURE OF A COMPILER THAT HAS HIGHER-ORDER FLOW ANALYSIS AT ITS CENTER -- TO EXPLORE THE TRANSFORMATIONS AND OPTIMIZATIONS THAT ARE ENABLED BY THIS COMBINATION OF REASONING ENGINE AND CODE REPRESENTATION. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CLASSES OF FACT ANNOTATIONS IS EXPLICIT INFORMATION ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT STRUCTURE REQUIRED TO MANAGE BINDINGS OF VARIABLES; THIS IS DESIGNED TO BE CLOSELY CONNECTED TO THE RUN-TIME MACHINE RESOURCES NEEDED FOR THESE BINDINGS (HEAP RECORDS, STACK FRAMES AND REGISTERS).

SYNTHESIZING THESE TECHNIQUES, MACHINE LEARNING AND NEW ALGORITHMS TO ENABLE THE REUSE-BASED COMPOSITION, SYNTHESIS, AND REPAIR OF SECURITY SENSITIVE REGEXES WILL BE APPLIED. PROJECT FINDINGS WILL BE EMBODIED IN A NOVEL PUBLICLY-ACCESSIBLE REGEX SEARCH ENGINE AND ACCOMPANYING TOOLS. IN PART TWO, THE TEAM WILL IMPROVE THE TRUSTWORTHINESS OF REGEX ENGINES BY ELIMINATING THE PROBLEMATIC WORST-CASE CHARACTERISTICS. THE TEAM HAS BEGUN EXPLORING ALGORITHMIC ADVANCES THAT ADDRESS ITS WORST-CASE SUPER-LINEAR BEHAVIOR. THE TEAM WILL DESIGN A REDOS-SAFE ALGORITHM WITH A PROVABLY CONSTANT SPACE BOUND AND DEVELOP NOVEL WORST-CASE ANALYSES FOR EXTENDED FEATURES (E.G., BACKREFERENCES). FOR PRACTICALITY, THE TEAM'S REGEX ENGINE CHANGES MUST BE TRANSPARENT. HOWEVER, BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY CHECKING FOR REGEX ENGINES IS AN OPEN PROBLEM. THE TEAM WILL DEVELOP THE FIRST REGEX ENGINE SEMANTIC TESTING TECHNIQUES, BASED ON METAMORPHIC AND DIFFERENTIAL TESTING; AND ENABLE REGEX ENGINE PERFORMANCE REGRESSION TESTING THROUGH THE FIRST SYSTEMATIC REGEX PERFORMANCE BENCHMARK.

ALTHOUGH MANY PRECLINICAL AND SOME CLINICAL STUDIES DEMONSTRATED THE POTENTIAL BENEFIT OF FLASH-RT, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF FLASH-RT FOR GENERAL CANCER PATIENTS IS TO BE FURTHER VALIDATED THROUGH CLINICAL TRIALS.  BY FAR THE ONLY COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE SYSTEM THAT CAN DELIVER ULTRA-HIGH DOSE RATES NEEDED FOR GENERAL- PURPOSE CLINICAL FLASH-RT IS THE PROTON MODALITY, SUCH AS OUR IBA SYSTEM. HOWEVER, THE STATE-OF-THE-ART TREATMENT PLANNING METHOD, I.E., INTENSITY MODULATED PROTON THERAPY (IMPT), ONLY OPTIMIZES THE DOSE AND DOES NOT DIRECTLY OPTIMIZE THE DOSE RATE OR THE FLASH EFFECT.

TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, SDDRO IS THE ONLY METHOD THAT CAN OPTIMIZE THE FLASH DOSE RATE AS WELL AS THE DOSE. OUR PRELIMINARY WORK (GAO ET AL 2020) FOR LUNG PATIENTS HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT, COMPARED WITH IMPT, SDDRO SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED THE FLASH-DOSE-RATE COVERAGE (IN ORDER TO HAVE THE FLASH EFFECT FOR REDUCING NORMAL- TISSUE TOXICITIES) WHILE PRESERVING THE DOSE COVERAGE, E.G., INCREASING OF THE TARGET-SURROUNDING VOLUME RECEIVING =40GY/S FROM ~40% TO AT LEAST 98%, AND THE LUNG VOLUME RECEIVING =40GY/S FROM ~30% TO ~80%, WHICH OCCURRED AT HIGH-DOSE AND HIGH-UNCERTAINTY LOCATIONS WITH HIGH-RISK RADIATION-INDUCED TOXICITIES. SUCH IMPROVED FLASH COVERAGE IS ESPECIALLY CRITICAL FOR REDUCING NORMAL TISSUE TOXICITIES GIVEN THE HYPOFRACTIONATION NATURE OF FLASH-RT.

OUR LAB IS UNIQUELY SUITED TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM: (I) USING FMRI, WE ARE READILY ABLE TO IDENTIFY REGIONS SPECIALIZED FOR REPRESENTING 3D STRUCTURE; (II) WE HAVE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IDENTIFYING THE DETAILED CODE USED BY THE BRAIN TO REPRESENT VISUAL OBJECTS THROUGH OUR WORK IN IT CORTEX; (III) WE HAVE EXPERIENCE USING CUTTING-EDGE RECORDING TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING NHP NEUROPIXELS PROBES AND CHRONIC BRUSH ARRAYS; (IV) WE HAVE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE USING CUTTING-EDGE DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS (DNNS) TO MODEL NEURAL ACTIVITY, INCLUDING COLLABORATIONS WITH DEEPMIND AND MACHINE LEARNING EXPERTS AT CALTECH.  WE PROPOSE TWO AIMS TO IDENTIFY THE CODING MECHANISMS FOR 3D STRUCTURE USED BY THE DORSAL (AIM 1) AND VENTRAL (AIM 2) STREAMS. A KEY INNOVATION DISTINGUISHING OUR APPROACH FROM PREVIOUS APPROACHES IS THAT WE WILL PRESENT AN EXTREMELY LARGE SET OF REALISTIC 3D OBJECTS, IN CONTRAST TO THE HIGHLY SIMPLIFIED STIMULI USED IN PREVIOUS STUDIES, AND WE WILL AIM TO USE SOPHISTICATED DATA ANALYSIS STRATEGIES TO IDENTIFY THE POPULATION CODING SCHEME USED BY DORSAL AND VENTRAL NEURAL POPULATIONS TO REPRESENT THESE OBJECTS. A SECOND KEY INNOVATION IS THAT WE WILL PERFORM EXACTLY PARALLEL EXPERIMENTS IN THE SAME ANIMALS ACROSS DORSAL AND VENTRAL STREAMS, ALLOWING DETAILED COMPARISON OF CODING MECHANISMS. BY UNDERSTANDING IN DETAIL HOW CHUNKS OF 3D MATTER IN THE WORLD ARE REPRESENTED IN THE PRIMATE BRAIN, WE WILL FILL A KEY MISSING GAP IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF VISUAL PERCEPTION AND THEREBY PROVIDE A NEW BRIDGE BETWEEN PERCEPTION AND BEHAVIOR. FURTHERMORE, UNDERSTANDING THE BRAIN’S 3D GEOMETRIC ENGINE MAY HELP DOCTORS AND SCIENTISTS DEVELOP BRAIN COMPUTER INTERFACES TO AID PATIENTS LACKING LIMBS OR THE ABILITY TO MOVE.",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,O,PRIVATE INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_F32EY033203_7529/,2022-07-05 21:06:35.08119+00

THE NEED THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED IS WITHIN TA 2.4.2.3: IN-SPACE TANK-TO-TANK PROPELLANT TRANSFER [1]. HUMAN MARS MISSIONS WILL REQUIRE EFFICIENT DELIVERY OF CRYOGENS FROM A SUPPLY TANK TO A RECEIVER TANK IN MICROGRAVITY. AS NOTED IN THE NASA SSTIP  STORAGE AND TRANSFER OF CRYOGENS IN SPACE IS CRITICAL FOR DEEP SPACE HUMAN EXPLORATION  MAKING IT ONE OF THE SIX NRC HIGH PRIORITIES WITHIN THE  LAUNCH AND IN-SPACE PROPULSION  CORE TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT. THE HIGH PERFORMANCE OFFERED BY THE CRYOGENIC PROPULSION WILL PERMIT LONGER RANGE MISSIONS  LARGER PAYLOAD MASSES  AND REDUCE HUMAN EXPOSURE TIME TO SPACE ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS. IN-SPACE TANK-TO-TANK TRANSFER IS COMPOSED OF THREE OPERATIONAL ELEMENTS   1) HIGH EFFICIENCY LINE CHILLDOWN  2) HIGH EFFICIENCY TANK CHILLDOWN  AND 3) NO-VENT FILL OF THE RECEIVER TANK. WHEN TRANSFERRING CRYOGEN FROM A SUPPLY TANK TO A RECEIVER TANK  THE TRANSFER LINE (I.E. PIPE AND VALVES) AND RECEIVER TANK ARE AT HIGH TEMPERATURES COMPARED TO THAT OF THE LIQUID PROPELLANT. CHILLDOWN IS THE PROCESS OF INTRODUCING THE CRYOGEN INTO THE SYSTEM TO COOL THE HARDWARE DOWN TO THE LIQUID TEMPERATURE. THE FLOWING PROPELLANT BOILS OFF AS IT COOLS THE LINE AND TANK. SINCE THE PROPELLANT IS ONLY STORABLE AND USEFUL TO THE ENGINE IN PURE LIQUID FORM  THIS VAPORIZED PROPELLANT IS VENTED OVERBOARD AND CONSIDERED  LOST . SINCE EACH OF THE THREE ELEMENTS IS A TWO-PHASE FLOW PROCESS  THEY ARE ALL HIGHLY INFLUENCED BY THE GRAVITY LEVEL. THE PI S GROUP HAS PREVIOUSLY PERFORMED MANY TERRESTRIAL CHILLDOWN AND MICROGRAVITY PARABOLIC FLIGHT CHILLDOWN EXPERIMENTS FOR PIPES. MORE DIFFICULT TO MODEL AND IN MOST CASES MORE IMPORTANT FOR THE PROPELLANT THERMAL MANAGEMENT IS THE CHILLDOWN OF THE RECEIVER TANK. THE RECEIVER TANK IS THE MOST MASSIVE COMPONENT OF THE SYSTEM TO BE CHILLED DOWN AND  THEREFORE  TAKES MUCH MORE TIME TO CHILL DOWN AND THUS MORE CRYOGEN CONSUMPTION. AS A RESULT  THE TIME AND PROPELLANT SPENT DURING CHILLDOWN WILL MOSTLY BE DICTATED BY HOW FAST THE TANK CAN BE CHILLED DOWN. BUT AT THIS TIME THERE HAVE BEEN NO STUDIES ON TANK CHILLDOWN IN ZERO GRAVITY. PREVIOUS TANK CHILLDOWN STUDIES HAVE BEEN LIMITED TO JUST 1G CONDITIONS AND WERE VERY SCARCE WITH ONLY TWO DATA SETS AVAILABLE AND THE EXPERIMENTS WERE POORLY EXECUTED [2]. THE PROPOSED PROJECT SEEKS TO FILL THIS VOID AND CLOSE THIS GAP BY CONDUCTING REDUCED GRAVITY EXPERIMENT FOR CRYOGENIC CHILLDOWN OF A RECEIVER TANK IN REDUCED GRAVITY  ANALYZING DATA  DEVELOPING MODELS  AND THEN SUGGEST OPTIMAL TANK CHILLDOWN METHODS.

THESE MATERIALS CAN POSSESS NOVEL AND EXCITING COMBINATIONS OF PHYSICAL PROPERTIES. IN PARTICULAR, A SUB-GROUP OF THESE ALLOYS, SO-CALLED REFRACTORY MPCAS EXHIBIT HIGH TEMPERATURE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES THAT SURPASS THOSE OF THE ALLOYS CURRENTLY IN USE. THE APPLICATION OF THESE NEW ALLOYS IN TURBINE ENGINES COULD THEREFORE RESULT IN HIGHER EFFICIENCY AND REDUCED GREENHOUSE EMISSIONS. CURRENT METHODS USED TO FABRICATE REFRACTORY MPCAS UTILIZE EXTREMELY HIGH TEMPERATURES, AND CAN RESULT IN COMPOSITIONAL VARIATIONS WITHIN THE ALLOY. THIS PROGRAM SEEKS TO EXPLORE A NEW PROCESS WHEREBY THE METALLIC ALLOY IS PRODUCED BY REDUCING A MIXTURE OF THE METALLIC OXIDES. THIS IS ACHIEVED BY HEAT-TREATMENT IN A HYDROGEN ENVIRONMENT. NOT ONLY IS THIS A NOVEL TECHNIQUE, BUT PRIOR WORK HAS SHOWN THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO CONVERT CERTAIN OXIDES THAT NORMALLY WOULD BE EXTREMELY STABLE. THE RESEARCH SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND THIS UNEXPECTED ASPECT OF THE OXIDE REDUCTION PROCESS. A RATIONALE IS SUGGESTED WHEREBY THE REDUCTION IS ENHANCED BY THE COMPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT. THIS MODEL IS TESTED BY STUDYING THE REDUCTION BEHAVIOR OF A RANGE OF MPCAS COMPOSED OF DIFFERENT ELEMENTAL COMBINATIONS. COMPUTER MODELLING IS USED TO HELP IDENTIFY ALLOY COMBINATIONS WITH THERMODYNAMIC CHARACTERISTICS THAT SHOW PROMISE BASED ON THE MODEL. THESE RESEARCH FINDINGS COULD LEAD TO ENHANCED PROCESSING OF TAILORED MPCA COMPOSITIONS, WITH POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT SOCIETAL IMPACT IN MANY TECHNOLOGICAL AREAS, INCLUDING ENERGY STORAGE AND GENERATION, TRANSPORTATION, AND MEDICAL DEVICES. OUTREACH ACTIVITIES RELATING TO ALLOY DESIGN AND FORMING FOCUS ON ENCOURAGING UNDER-REPRESENTED MINORITIES TO PURSUE OPPORTUNITIES IN STEM FIELDS, AND TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AMONGST MIDDLE- AND HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENTS. TECHNICAL SUMMARY THE AIM OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO DEVELOP A SCIENTIFIC FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEX REDUCTION BEHAVIOR OF A MIXTURE OF OXIDE MATERIALS, AND HENCE ESTABLISH COMPOSITION-BASED STRATEGIES FOR THE PROCESSING OF TECHNOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT MULTI-PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ALLOYS (MPCAS). THIS RESEARCH BUILDS ON PRIOR WORK THAT DEMONSTRATED THAT MPCAS CAN BE FABRICATED VIA THE REDUCTION OF A COMPACTED METAL-OXIDE MIXTURE. ALLOYS COMPOSED OF CO, CR, FE, NI AND MN HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY SYNTHESIZED BY THIS ROUTE, USING RELATIVELY MILD HEAT-TREATMENT CONDITIONS FOR WHICH THE REDUCTION OF MNO WOULD NOT BE EXPECTED. A MODEL IS PROPOSED WHEREBY THE THERMODYNAMIC DRIVING FORCE FOR REDUCTION IS ENHANCED DUE TO THE FORMATION OF THE ALLOY SOLID SOLUTION. ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE CALCULATIONS OF THE ENTHALPY OF MIXING GUIDE THE SELECTION OF ELEMENTAL COMBINATIONS FOR TESTING. THE REDUCTION BEHAVIOR OF THESE OXIDE COMPOSITIONS ARE STUDIED UNDER CONTROLLED CONDITIONS OF TEMPERATURE AND OXYGEN PARTIAL PRESSURE (PO2). THE SEQUENCE OF REACTIONS AND PHASE EVOLUTION IS REVEALED BY THE CHARACTERIZATION OF PARTIALLY REDUCED SAMPLES USING SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (SEM) AND SCANNING TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (STEM) TECHNIQUES, AS WELL AS IN-SITU X-RAY DIFFRACTION REDUCTION STUDIES USING A SYNCHROTRON LIGHT SOURCE. IDENTIFICATION OF THE NUCLEATION MECHANISMS OF THE METALLIC PHASES, ROLE OF TRANSIENT PHASES, AND RATE-CONTROLLING TRANSPORT MECHANISMS IS OF BROAD FUNDAMENTAL INTEREST, AND BENEFIT RELATED RESEARCH ON CATALYSIS AND OXYGEN LOOPING. THE ENHANCED PROCESSING OF TAILORED MPCA COMPOSITIONS, BOTH BULK AND POWDER, IS EXPEDITED BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOLID SOLUTION MODEL, SINCE IT WILL HELP IDENTIFY THE HEAT TREATMENT AND COMPOSITIONAL PARAMETERS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO THE PROCESS. THE RESEARCH ALSO BENEFITS THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY BY GENERATING REDUCTION-COMPOSITION DIAGRAMS FOR SELECT MPCA ELEMENTAL COMBINATIONS. OUTREACH ACTIVITIES RELATING TO ALLOY DESIGN AND FORMING INCLUDE CHOICES (CHARTING HORIZONS AND OPPORTUNITIES IN CAREERS IN ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE), WHICH IS DEDICATED TO ENCOURAGING MIDDLE-SCHOOL GIRLS TO CONSIDER CAREERS IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, AND THE ASM TEACHER AND HIGH SCHOOL MATERIALS CAMPS, DESIGNED TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AMONGST HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS.

MANY CRITICAL SYSTEMS OF MODERN SOCIETY (E.G., ENGINE CONTROL UNITS IN AUTOMOBILES, LOGIC CONTROLLERS IN MANUFACTURING AND POWER PLANTS, AIRCRAFT CONTROL AND NAVIGATION SYSTEMS, INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS, SENSING AND PERCEPTION SYSTEMS IN ROBOT-AIDED HEALTHCARE) HAVE REAL-TIME (I.E., STRICT TIMING AND SAFETY) REQUIREMENTS. EMERGING INTERNET-OF-THINGS-SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS (E.G., CONNECTED AUTONOMOUS CARS, UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES), THE TRENDING USE OF OFF-THE-SHELF COMPONENTS, AND WIDESPREAD INTERNET/NETWORK CONNECTIVITY EXPAND THE POSSIBILITY OF SECURITY BREACHES IN THOSE CRITICAL SYSTEMS, AS REVEALED BY RECENT REAL-WORLD ATTACKS. THE KEY INNOVATION OF THIS RESEARCH IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A UNIFIED FRAMEWORK TO INTEGRATE MONITORING AND DETECTION MECHANISMS AS FIRST-CLASS ELEMENTS WITHIN THE DESIGN OF REAL-TIME SYSTEMS, ESPECIALLY THOSE BUILT WITH MULTICORE CHIPS. THIS PROJECT WILL (A) DEVISE NOVEL ALGORITHMS, SCHEDULING MODELS, AND FRAMEWORKS TO INTEGRATE SECURITY INTO MULTICORE PLATFORMS THAT ARE COGNIZANT OF REAL-TIME REQUIREMENTS, (B) BUILD DESIGN-TIME TOOLS AND SYSTEM-LEVEL PLUGINS TO INCORPORATE THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUES INTO OFF-THE-SHELF SYSTEMS, AND (C) DEVELOP METRICS TO CAREFULLY TRADE-OFF TWO CONTENDING REQUIREMENTS: TIMELINESS AND SECURITY. THE IDEAS WILL BE VALIDATED THROUGH EXPERIMENTATION AND TESTING ON TWO OFF-THE-SHELF PLATFORMS: A MULTI-TERRAIN ROVER AND A SIX-DEGREE-OF-FREEDOM ROBOTIC ARM. THIS RESEARCH WILL ADVANCE THE FIELD BY ENABLING SYSTEM DESIGNERS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW TO INTEGRATE SECURITY CONCERNS, WITH A FOCUS ON REVEALING SECURITY TRADE-OFFS TO ENSURE MINIMAL (OR NO) PERTURBATIONS ON REAL-TIME PROPERTIES. TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED AS PART OF THIS PROJECT WILL MAKE SAFETY-CRITICAL, REAL-TIME SYSTEMS MORE SECURE AND APPLICABLE TO VARIOUS DOMAINS (E.G., AUTOMOBILES, AVIONICS, DRONES, SPACE ROVERS, POWER GRIDS, MANUFACTURING PLANTS, MEDICAL DEVICES, INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS). THE PROPOSED RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL PLANS WILL ENHANCE THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE NEXT-GENERATION TECHNOLOGICAL WORKFORCE IN CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS AND CYBER-SECURITY.

THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT GAP BETWEEN THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL NURSING EDUCATION PROGRAMS, MAKING FOR A DIFFICULT TRANSITION FROM EDUCATION TO WORK ENVIRONMENTS. NURSING PROGRAMS HAVE LONG RELIED ON LOW- AND HIGH-FIDELITY MANIKINS, WHICH VARY FROM SIMPLY REPLICAS OF HUMAN BEINGS/BODY PARTS WITH LIMITED TO NO DISTINGUISHING FEATURES TO COMPARATIVE HUMAN MODELS WITH ADJUSTABLE PHYSIOLOGICAL TRAITS. HOWEVER, MANIKINS CAN BE LIMITED IN THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN PROVIDING DIVERSE PATIENT SCENARIOS OR MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS FOR CONCEPTUAL, PHYSICAL, AND EMOTIONAL/PSYCHOLOGICAL FIDELITY THAT WILL ENSURE THAT PATIENT SIMULATION IS ACCURATE. TASK TRAINING MANIKINS, SUCH AS THOSE USED TO TEACH IV AND NG PLACEMENT, LACK LIVE TISSUE FIDELITY, WHICH COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED WITH HAPTIC TECHNOLOGY. FURTHER, MANIKINS ALONE CANNOT PROVIDE REAL-TIME VISUALIZATION OF INTERNAL ANATOMY AND A LIMITED CAPACITY TO SIMULATE COMPLICATIONS FROM INCORRECT DEVICE PLACEMENT. THE EMERGENCE OF SIMULATION-BASED MODELS FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION ADDRESSES THE NEED FOR REQUIRED SKILL DEVELOPMENT OF HEALTHCARE TRAINEES, INCLUDING MANIKIN TRAINING, VIRTUAL REALITY, AND INTERACTIVE MEDICAL SIMULATION SOFTWARE. THE USE OF NURSE TRAINING SIMULATIONS IN A BLENDED LEARNING ENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN REPORTED TO LOWER THE NUMBER OF IV INSERTION ATTEMPTS AND REDUCE IV-RELATED COMPLICATIONS ON SUBSEQUENT PATIENTS. TO IMPROVE THIS FORM OF EDUCATION, ARCHIEMD WILL PROVIDE NURSES WITH IMMERSIVE HAPTIC TRAINING SIMULATIONS TO HELP THEM PRACTICE AND ACQUIRE SKILLS AND GAIN CONFIDENCE IN PERFORMING PERIPHERAL IV AND NGT INSERTION. BY INTEGRATING VISUAL 3D COMPUTER MODELS WITH A GAME ENGINE AND HAPTICS, ARCHIEMD WILL PROVIDE AN IMMERSIVE VIRTUAL REALITY (VR) TRAINING ENVIRONMENT FOR NURSING STUDENTS. THIS WILL OFFER A NEW MODALITY FOR SIMULATION TRAINING, WITH THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE FORCE OR TACTILE FEEDBACK THAT SIMULATES A VIRTUAL OBJECT'S PHYSICAL SUBSTRATE. HAPTICS TECHNOLOGY AND COMPUTER-GENERATED IMAGERY CAN SIMULATE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ANATOMY, ENHANCE NURSE TRAINING ACTIVITIES, AND SUCCESSFULLY TRANSFER SIMULATOR- ACQUIRED SKILLS TO REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS. THE PROPOSED TECHNOLOGY WILL PROMOTE IMPROVED LEARNING THROUGH BOTH ""HANDS-ON"" CLINICAL EDUCATION AND ENSURE PATIENT FIDELITY. THE PHASE I RESEARCH EFFORT WILL BE COMPRISED OF TWO AIMS: 1) DEVELOP SIMULATIONS FOR IV INSERTION AND NGT PROCEDURES, INCORPORATING 3D COMPUTER MODELS AND A STYLUS WITH HAPTIC FEEDBACK, AND 2) CARRY OUT A USER STUDY TO EVALUATE THE HAPTIC SIMULATIONS' PERFORMANCE IN TRANSFERRING PERIPHERAL IV AND NGT INSERTION SKILLS. THE HAPTICS TECHNOLOGY DESIGNED HERE WILL SUPPORT IMMERSIVE SIMULATION TRAINING, ALLOWING NURSING EDUCATION PROGRAMS TO SUPPLEMENT LECTURE- OR OBSERVATION-BASED TRAINING OR REPLACE CURRENT TASK TRAINER MANIKINS.

THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO DEVELOP STRATEGIES FOR THE MORE CHALLENGING SETTING WHERE MULTIPLE DECISION MAKERS MUST COORDINATE WITH EACH OTHER ON SUCH PROBLEMS, BUT HAVE LIMITED COMMUNICATION AVAILABLE TO DO SO. FURTHERMORE, THIS PROJECT WILL SUPPORT UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE RESEARCH TRAINING, AS WELL AS GRADUATE-LEVEL COURSE DEVELOPMENT, IN MACHINE LEARNING AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, PREPARING STUDENTS FOR CAREERS IN ADVANCED TECHNICAL FIELDS. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP NOVEL, PROVABLY GOOD STRATEGIES FOR SOLVING SEQUENTIAL DECISION PROBLEMS (MULTI-ARMED BANDIT PROBLEMS) WHEN THE ACTIONS AVAILABLE HAVE A COMBINATORIAL STRUCTURE (SUCH AS CHOOSING SUBSETS OF PRODUCTS TO RECOMMEND), THE REWARDS HAVE A DIMINISHING RETURNS PROPERTY (SUBMODULARITY), AND THERE IS NO SIDE-INFORMATION AVAILABLE -- THE ONLY FEEDBACK COMES FROM THE REWARD ITSELF. THE PROPOSED WORK BUILDS ON THE RICH LITERATURE OF MULTI-ARMED BANDITS AND OF SUBMODULAR OPTIMIZATION. THE TECHNICAL AIMS OF THE PROJECT ARE DIVIDED INTO TWO THRUSTS. THE FIRST THRUST FOCUSES ON DEVELOPING ALGORITHMS AND IDENTIFYING THEIR REGRET BOUNDS FOR COMBINATORIAL MULTI-ARMED BANDIT PROBLEMS WITH SUBMODULAR REWARDS AND NO ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK. THE SECOND THRUST EXTENDS THOSE STRATEGIES AND REGRET ANALYSES TO A DECENTRALIZED SETTING, WHERE MULTIPLE AGENTS COORDINATE TO SOLVE COMBINATORIAL MULTI-ARMED BANDIT PROBLEMS, DESPITE LIMITED RESOURCES FOR COMMUNICATION.

THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE IS BEING PHASED OUT AND REPLACED BY ELECTRICITY, SETTING THE STAGE FOR AN INCREASED DEMAND FOR AUTONOMOUS AND EV TECHNOLOGIES. THIS CHANGING TECHNOLOGICAL CLIMATE AND THE RESULTANT CONCURRENT GLOBAL COMPETITION NECESSITATE TRANSFORMATION AT EVERY LEVEL OF AUTOMOTIVE DEVELOPMENT ? FROM EV DESIGNERS TO EV TECHNICIANS. THE DEMAND FOR SKILLED EV MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRY TECHNICIANS IS SUBSTANTIAL AND IS PREDICTED TO INCREASE AT A RATE WHERE DEMAND OUTPACES QUANTITY. WORKERS AGING OUT OF THE WORKFORCE, THE LACK OF ADVANCED STEM SKILLS FOR THOSE CURRENTLY IN THE WORKFORCE, AND INCREASED ECONOMIC EXPANSION ARE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THIS DEFICIT. COLLABORATION AMONG EDUCATORS AND EMPLOYERS MUST OCCUR TO ADVANCE THE UNDERSTANDING OF WORKFORCE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES. TO MEET THE NEED, A FACULTY-DRIVEN CONSORTIUM OF TWO-YEAR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION (IHES), OTHER ATE PROJECTS AND CENTERS, AND INDUSTRY WILL COLLABORATE TO ADDRESS THE NEXT GENERATION CROSS-DISCIPLINARY WORKFORCE NEEDS OF THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE (EV) MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRY THROUGH AN INNOVATIVE HYBRID VIRTUAL AND AUGMENTED REALITY (VR/AR) EDUCATION APPROACH. THE CONSORTIUM PROJECT PARTNERS INCLUDE: VOLVO, DAIMLER, BMW, PROTERRA, BOSCH, DUKE ENERGY, MICHELIN, THE UPSTATE SC ALLIANCE, THE SOUTH CAROLINA MANUFACTURING EXTENSION PARTNERSHIP, THE SOUTH CAROLINA TECHNICAL COLLEGE SYSTEM, THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR AUTONOMOUS TECHNOLOGIES, THE NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY TRAINING AND EDUCATION CENTER, THE REGIONAL CENTER FOR NUCLEAR EDUCATION, AND THE NORTHWEST ENGINEERING AND VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY EXCHANGE. THE PROJECT GOALS WILL ADDRESS CURRENT AND FUTURE EV MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRY NEEDS FOR BOTH TWO-YEAR COLLEGE STUDENTS AND INCUMBENT WORKERS. GOAL 1: IDENTIFY CURRENT AND FUTURE EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE NEEDS REQUIRED BY THE MIGRATION OF THE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY FROM TRADITIONAL FUELS TO BATTERY-POWERED ELECTRIC VEHICLES. GOAL 2: CREATE, DEPLOY, AND ASSESS AN INNOVATIVE, CREATIVE, AND INFORMED CROSS- DISCIPLINARY EV MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRY TECHNICIAN EDUCATION HYBRID CURRICULA INCORPORATING CLASSROOM, VIRTUAL, AND EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING. STRATEGIES WILL BE IMPLEMENTED TO SUPPORT PARTICIPATION AND PERSISTENCE IN EV MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE TECHNICIAN EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE RURAL, VETERANS, AND THOSE HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED IN STEM CAREER PATHWAYS. GOAL 3: DEVELOP AND/OR STRENGTHEN PARTNERSHIPS WITH CONSORTIUM MEMBERS, ATE PROJECTS AND CENTERS, AND INDUSTRY TO LEVERAGE AND SHARE EXPERTISE AND BEST PRACTICES FOR MAXIMUM IMPACT AND SUSTAINABILITY WITHIN AND ACROSS FIELDS AND INSTITUTIONS.

A PROMISING CONCEPT IS TO MIX PETROLEUM FUELS WITH BIO-DERIVED FUELS. AN EVALUATION OF THE PERFORMANCE BENEFITS RESTS ON DIAGNOSTICS TO UNRAVEL THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SOOT FORMATION AND FUEL PROPERTIES. UNDER SOME CONDITIONS THE PRESENCE OF SOOT ITSELF IN THE COMBUSTION FIELD CAN INTRUDE ON THIS EFFORT. MEASUREMENTS THAT RELY ON DIGITAL VIDEO IMAGING OF THE FUEL BURNING PROCESS  SUCH AS EMPLOYED IN THE FLAME EXTINGUISHMENT EXPERIMENT (FLEX)  ARE VULNERABLE TO THIS CONCERN. FLEX WAS DEVELOPED TO UNDERSTAND MECHANISMS THAT CONTROL FLAME EXTINCTION AS IT RELATES TO CABIN FIRE SAFETY ABOARD MANNED SPACEFLIGHT  THOUGH THE BROAD METHODOLOGIES ARE MORE WIDELY APPLICABLE TO COMBUSTION OF FUEL SYSTEMS IN COMBUSTION ENGINES. THE CONFIGURATION OF ISOLATED DROPLETS BURNING WITH NEAR SPHERICAL SYMMETRY WAS EMPLOYED TO ELUCIDATE THE MECHANISMS INVOLVED. THE MAIN DIAGNOSTIC WAS DIGITAL VIDEO IMAGING. FROM THIS INFORMATION  QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENTS OF THE DROPLET AND FLAME BOUNDARIES WERE MADE USING SUITABLE COMPUTER-BASED DATA EXTRACTION ALGORITHMS THAT REVEALED THE INFLUENCE OF AMBIENT GAS CONDITIONS AND LIQUID FUEL PROPERTIES ON FLAME EXTINCTION. FOR SOME OF THE FUELS EMPLOYED IN FLEX  SOOT FORMATION WAS EVIDENT (I.E.  N-HEPTANE DROPLETS BURNING IN AIR) WHICH OBSCURED PART OF THE DROPLET AND FLAME BOUNDARY THAT CAN COMPROMISE DATA ACCURACY. THE SUCCESS OF THE FLEX PROGRAM ASSUMES THE EXISTENCE OF EFFICIENT AND ACCURATE COMPUTER-BASED ALGORITHMS THAT CAN OVERCOME THE OBSCURATION INFLUENCE OF SOOT ON DROPLETS  ARE ABLE TO TRACK DROPLETS IF THEY MOVE  AND CAN ACCOUNT FOR DEVIATIONS FROM SPHERICITY DUE TO IGNITION DISTURBANCES. HOWEVER  THIS IS NOT THE CASE. COMMERCIAL IMAGE ANALYSIS PACKAGES ARE LIMITED IN THEIR ABILITY TO DEAL WITH THE PRESENCE OF SOOT IN THE IMAGING FIELD WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT USER INPUT. FAILURE TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM IMPACTS NOT ONLY DERIVING FULL BENEFIT FROM THE FLEX EXPERIMENTS ALREADY CARRIED OUT  BUT ALSO FOLLOW-ON STUDIES WHICH WOULD UTILIZE DIGITAL VIDEO IMAGING TO STUDY DROPLET COMBUSTION DYNAMICS OF SOOTING FUELS USED IN COMMERCIAL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS. IN THIS PROPOSAL WE ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BE DEVELOPING A DIAMETER ESTIMATION REFINEMENT ALGORITHM THAT EMPLOYS CONCEPTS WHICH AUTOMATE DROPLET AND FLAME DIAMETER MEASUREMENTS FROM VIDEO IMAGES IN THE PRESENCE OF SOOT. THE ALGORITHM WILL BE USED TO REANALYZE CERTAIN FLEX DATA ON THE PSI SYSTEM - RESULTS FROM A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT PROGRAM ARE INCLUDED IN THE PROPOSAL FOR ILLUSTRATION - AND TO EXTRACT QUANTITATIVE DATA FROM NEW PROPOSED EXPERIMENTS TO STUDY THE INFLUENCE OF MIXTURE FRACTION ON BLENDS OF BIO-DERIVED FUELS WITH AN AVIATION FUEL: HYDROPROCESSED RENEWABLE JET FUEL DERIVED FROM ALGAE WITH JET-A (ALGAL FEEDSTOCKS HAVE POTENTIAL FOR LARGER YIELDS COMPARED TO OUTER SOURCES) FOR WHICH SOOT FORMATION IS EXPECTED. THE OUTCOME WILL BE A ROBUST CAPABILITY TO PROCESS DIGITAL VIDEO IMAGES THAT EFFICIENTLY AND PRECISELY EXTRACTS MEASUREMENTS FROM DIGITAL IMAGES EVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF SOOT AGGREGATES. THE RESULTS - DATA AND SOFTWARE - WILL BE FREELY AVAILABLE ON VARIOUS OUTLETS AS DISCUSSED IN THE PROPOSAL. THE PROJECT INCLUDES A TEAM WITH EXPERTISE IN DEVELOPING ALGORITHMS FOR IMAGE ANALYSIS (PROF. ANTHONY REEVES OF CORNELL'S ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT) AND EXPERIENCE IN DROPLET COMBUSTION EXPERIMENTATION (PROF. C. THOMAS AVEDISIAN OF CORNELL'S MECHANICAL AND AEROSPACE ENGINEERING (MAE) DEPARTMENT).

OUR PROPOSAL PROMOTES A MORE FLEXIBLE AND TAILORED APPROACH TO REACH UNDERSERVED GROUPS. RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY WOMEN ARE AT INCREASED RISK FOR POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION, AND THEIR CHILDREN AS LESS LIKELY TO HAVE HAD WELL-CHILD CHECKUPS IN THE PAST YEAR. MOREOVER, RACIAL/ETHNIC DISPARITIES ARE STILL PREVALENT FOR MATERNAL AND INFANT MORTALITY AS WELL AS VARIOUS HEALTH BEHAVIORS SUCH AS SAFE SLEEP PRACTICES, BREASTFEEDING, AND INFANT NUTRITION. CURRENTLY, SOME POPULAR PROGRAMS INVOLVE RESOURCE-INTENSIVE HOME VISITS (LIMITED IN SCALE DUE TO STAFF AND COST CONSTRAINTS) OR NON-PERSONALIZED TEXT MESSAGES (MAY NOT DIRECTLY ADDRESS AN INDIVIDUAL’S QUESTIONS). WE PROPOSE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CHATBOT THAT ADDRESSES BOTH OF THESE POSSIBLE LIMITATIONS BY REPRESENTING A SCALABLE TOOL THAT CAN HAVE WIDESPREAD REACH ACROSS GEOGRAPHIES AND IS PERSONALIZED AND RESPONSIVE TO AN INDIVIDUAL’S SPECIFIC INFORMATIONAL NEEDS. WE HAVE BUILT A PROTOTYPE OF THE CHATBOT, ROSIE, CAPABLE OF ENGAGING IN LIVE QUESTION-AND-ANSWER SESSIONS. ROSIE IS ABLE TO RESPOND TO 334 POPULAR QUESTIONS THAT NEW MOTHERS MAY HAVE. PRETESTS WITH MOTHER GROUPS AND MARY’S CENTER PATIENTS HAVE SHOWED A POSITIVE RECEPTION TO THE CHATBOT. OVER THE COURSE OF THE GRANT, WE WILL LEVERAGE RECENT ADVANCES IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND THE EMERGENCE OF EFFORTS TO AGGREGATE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF HEALTH INFORMATION, TO ASSEMBLE A COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH INFORMATION LIBRARY. WE WILL FURTHER REFINE ROSIE’S DIALOGUE ANALYZER AND RESPONSE INFERENCE ENGINE TO ROBUSTLY RECOGNIZE AND RESPOND TO USER’S QUESTIONS IN THE VARIOUS AND COMPLEX WAYS THEY CAN PHRASE A QUESTION. WE WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT ROSIE MAY LOWER RISK OF POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION, DECREASE EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS, AND INCREASE ATTENDANCE OF WELL-BABY VISITS. WE WILL EMPLOY PRIMARILY A VIRTUAL RECRUITMENT STRATEGY TO CONDUCT A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF THIS INTERVENTION ON MATERNAL AND INFANT OUTCOMES. OUR INVESTIGATIVE TEAM—COMPRISED OF EXPERTS IN THE FIELD OF EPIDEMIOLOGY, COMPUTER SCIENCE, BIOSTATISTICS, AND MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH EXPERTS—IS UNIQUELY SUITED TO IMPLEMENT THE STUDY AIMS. OUR SPECIFIC AIMS ARE: 1) DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY FOR A CHATBOT, ROSIE, THAT WILL PROVIDE HEALTH INFORMATIONAL SUPPORT TO VULNERABLE MOTHERS THE MOMENT THEY NEED IT; 2) EVALUATE THE USE OF ROSIE ON MATERNAL AND INFANT OUTCOMES; AND 3) RELEASE AN OPEN-SOURCE PACKET FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A CHATBOT. ROSIE PROVIDES INFORMATIONAL SUPPORT TO VULNERABLE MOMS THE MOMENT THEY NEED IT AND SAFEGUARDS NEW MOMS FROM MISINFORMATION THAT IS COMMON ON THE WEB WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF CLOSING THE GAP IN MATERNAL AND INFANT OUTCOMES.

THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE IS BEING PHASED OUT AND REPLACED BY ELECTRICITY, SETTING THE STAGE FOR AN INCREASED DEMAND FOR AUTONOMOUS AND EV TECHNOLOGIES. THIS CHANGING TECHNOLOGICAL CLIMATE AND THE RESULTANT CONCURRENT GLOBAL COMPETITION NECESSITATE TRANSFORMATION AT EVERY LEVEL OF AUTOMOTIVE DEVELOPMENT ? FROM EV DESIGNERS TO EV TECHNICIANS. THE DEMAND FOR SKILLED EV MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRY TECHNICIANS IS SUBSTANTIAL AND IS PREDICTED TO INCREASE AT A RATE WHERE DEMAND OUTPACES QUANTITY. WORKERS AGING OUT OF THE WORKFORCE, THE LACK OF ADVANCED STEM SKILLS FOR THOSE CURRENTLY IN THE WORKFORCE, AND INCREASED ECONOMIC EXPANSION ARE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THIS DEFICIT. COLLABORATION AMONG EDUCATORS AND EMPLOYERS MUST OCCUR TO ADVANCE THE UNDERSTANDING OF WORKFORCE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES. TO MEET THE NEED, A FACULTY-DRIVEN CONSORTIUM OF TWO-YEAR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION (IHES), OTHER ATE PROJECTS AND CENTERS, AND INDUSTRY WILL COLLABORATE TO ADDRESS THE NEXT GENERATION CROSS-DISCIPLINARY WORKFORCE NEEDS OF THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE (EV) MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRY THROUGH AN INNOVATIVE HYBRID VIRTUAL AND AUGMENTED REALITY (VR/AR) EDUCATION APPROACH. THE CONSORTIUM PROJECT PARTNERS INCLUDE: VOLVO, DAIMLER, BMW, PROTERRA, BOSCH, DUKE ENERGY, MICHELIN, THE UPSTATE SC ALLIANCE, THE SOUTH CAROLINA MANUFACTURING EXTENSION PARTNERSHIP, THE SOUTH CAROLINA TECHNICAL COLLEGE SYSTEM, THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR AUTONOMOUS TECHNOLOGIES, THE NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY TRAINING AND EDUCATION CENTER, THE REGIONAL CENTER FOR NUCLEAR EDUCATION, AND THE NORTHWEST ENGINEERING AND VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY EXCHANGE. THE PROJECT GOALS WILL ADDRESS CURRENT AND FUTURE EV MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRY NEEDS FOR BOTH TWO-YEAR COLLEGE STUDENTS AND INCUMBENT WORKERS. GOAL 1: IDENTIFY CURRENT AND FUTURE EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE NEEDS REQUIRED BY THE MIGRATION OF THE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY FROM TRADITIONAL FUELS TO BATTERY-POWERED ELECTRIC VEHICLES. GOAL 2: CREATE, DEPLOY, AND ASSESS AN INNOVATIVE, CREATIVE, AND INFORMED CROSS- DISCIPLINARY EV MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRY TECHNICIAN EDUCATION HYBRID CURRICULA INCORPORATING CLASSROOM, VIRTUAL, AND EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING. STRATEGIES WILL BE IMPLEMENTED TO SUPPORT PARTICIPATION AND PERSISTENCE IN EV MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE TECHNICIAN EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE RURAL, VETERANS, AND THOSE HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED IN STEM CAREER PATHWAYS. GOAL 3: DEVELOP AND/OR STRENGTHEN PARTNERSHIPS WITH CONSORTIUM MEMBERS, ATE PROJECTS AND CENTERS, AND INDUSTRY TO LEVERAGE AND SHARE EXPERTISE AND BEST PRACTICES FOR MAXIMUM IMPACT AND SUSTAINABILITY WITHIN AND ACROSS FIELDS AND INSTITUTIONS. GOAL 4: PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ADDRESSING THE NEW EV CURRICULA TO ENSURE WIDESPREAD USE, DISSEMINATION, AND FACULTY LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT.

ATOMIC LAYER DEPOSITION (ALD) WILL BE USED TO APPLY A PINHOLE-FREE  CONFORMAL NANOFILM TO BOTH FUEL PARTICLES AND FUEL ELEMENT CLADDING  INCLUDING THE HIGH ASPECT RATIO HYDROGEN FLOW CHANNELS. THE FILM WILL ACT AS A BARRIER TOWARDS HYDROGEN DIFFUSION TO REDUCE EMBRITTLEMENT OF THE UNDERLYING CERMET FUEL. THIS WILL EXTEND THE LIFE OF THE FUEL AND PREVENT THE RELEASE OF HAZARDOUS FISSION PRODUCTS. THINNER FILMS ALSO HAVE A DECREASED THERMAL DIFFUSION RESISTANCE AND INCREASED ELASTICITY. GIVEN THE WEIGHT AND VOLUME RESTRICTIONS OF SPACECRAFT  ALD NANOFILMS ARE IDEAL COATINGS. TUNGSTEN (W)  MOLYBDENUM(MO)  AND ALLOYS OF THE TWO ELEMENTS WILL BE USED TO FORM NANOFILMS VIA ALD FIRST ON SURROGATE FUEL PARTICLES AND THEN ON URANIUM FUEL PARTICLES. ALD OF CHEMICALLY-BONDED NANOFILMS UTILIZES SELF-LIMITING SURFACE REACTIONS TO ACHIEVE UNIFORM FILMS WITH THICKNESS DEPENDENT ON THE NUMBER OF ALD CYCLES. THE HIGH CONTROL OF THICKNESS ALLOWS FOR THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF MATERIAL TO BE USED. SURROGATE FUEL PARTICLES WILL BE COATED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO (CU) FOR COMPARING BARRIER MATERIALS AND FOR PROOF-OF-CONCEPT TESTING. ONCE SURROGATE TESTING IS COMPLETE  A NEW ALD PROCESSING SYSTEM WILL BE CONSTRUCTED AT IDAHO NATIONAL LAB (INL) TO COAT URANIUM FUEL AND URANIUM FUEL ELEMENTS WITH THE BEST-PERFORMING MATERIAL. AFTER DEPOSITION ON SURROGATE PARTICLES  FILMS WILL BE CHARACTERIZED AT CU TO ENSURE FULL COVERAGE AND MEASURE FILM THICKNESS. THE COATED SURROGATE PARTICLES WILL BE FORMED INTO FUEL ELEMENT SECTIONS AT INL WHICH WILL THEN BE RETURNED TO CU TO BE COATED WITH THE SAME ALD CHEMISTRY. THE COATED SECTION WILL THEN BE RETURNED TO INL FOR FILM EFFICACY TESTING USING THERMAL CYCLING. IN ADDITION  HOT HYDROGEN TESTING WILL BE PERFORMED USING CFEET AT NASA MARSHALL SPACE FLIGHT CENTER. STATE OF THE ART TECHNOLOGY FOR PROTECTING FISSION MATERIAL CURRENTLY USES CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION (CVD) AND POST-PROCESSING. CVD ALLOWS FOR GAS PHASE REACTIONS SINCE IT DOSES SUBSTRATES WITH MORE THAN ONE PRECURSOR SIMULTANEOUSLY. THIS RESULTS IN THE DEPOSITION OF NANOPARTICLES AND POROUS FILMS WHICH OFTEN DELAMINATE FROM THE SUBSTRATE. TYPICALLY  ANNEALING IS REQUIRED TO REDUCE POROSITY AND HELP BOND THE COATING TO THE SUBSTRATE. BY ITS NATURE  CVD WILL CLOG ENTRANCES OF HIGH ASPECT RATIO CHANNELS. ALD  HOWEVER  WILL COAT THE LENGTH OF THE CHANNEL  AND LITERATURE AS WELL AS CU REPORTS 100% COVERAGE OF SURFACES AND OF HIGH ASPECT RATIO PORES. THE REDUCTION IN FILM THICKNESS FROM MICRONS TO NANOMETERS WITH RESPECT TO CVD MEANS LESS FUNDS WASTED ON PRECURSORS  LESS FUEL VOLUME DISPLACED BY COATINGS  AND LESS OVERALL WEIGHT OF COATING REQUIRED. MATERIALS TESTED EXPERIMENTALLY WILL ALSO BE ANALYZED COMPUTATIONALLY. DENSITY FUNCTIONAL THEORY  SPECIFICALLY NUDGED ELASTIC BAND METHOD  WILL BE USED TO CALCULATE ENERGY BARRIERS TOWARDS ELEMENTAL HYDROGEN DIFFUSION. THE HIGHER THE THEORETICAL BARRIER  THE HIGHER THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE COATING PREVENTING HYDROGEN EMBRITTLEMENT. THIS METHOD WILL ALSO BE USED TO PREDICT MATERIALS IN ADDITION TO W AND MO MOLECULAR DYNAMICS WILL BE USED TO SIMULATE HEATING OF THE COATING AND POTENTIAL DELAMINATION OR CRACKING. THESE COMPUTATIONAL STUDIES WILL INCREASE UNDERSTANDING OF HYDROGEN DIFFUSION. USING ALD FOR NANOFILM BARRIER COATINGS ON FUEL PARTICLES AND FUEL ELEMENTS WILL RAISE THE TRL OF NPT FUEL AND DECREASE THE COMPLEXITY OF FUEL ELEMENT FABRICATION. DEVELOPMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION OF EFFICIENT COATINGS CAN BE EXTENDED TO USES BEYOND THIS PARTICULAR APPLICATION. ALD COATINGS OF PROPOSED MATERIALS CAN ADDITIONALLY BE USED ON HYDROGEN CONDUITS AND STORAGE VESSELS.

IN A SUBDUCTION ZONE, ONE TECTONIC PLATE DIVES BENEATH ANOTHER AND IS HEATED DURING ITS DESCENT INTO EARTH?S DEEP INTERIOR. WITH HEAT, THE HYDROUS MINERALS IN THE DOWN-GOING PLATE BREAKDOWN TO PRODUCE WATER-RICH FLUIDS. THESE FLUIDS ARE BUOYANT AND RISE BACK TO THE SURFACE, DRIVING CHEMICAL REACTIONS ALONG THEIR PATH. IMPORTANT GEOLOGICAL PHENOMENA DRIVEN BY THESE FLUIDS INCLUDE THE VIOLENT VOLCANOES THAT DOT THE PACIFIC RING OF FIRE, THE ECONOMIC CONCENTRATION OF CRITICAL ELEMENTS ALONG THE EDGES OF CONTINENTS, THE PRODUCTION OF CONTINENTAL CRUST, AND THE ADDITION AND REPLENISHMENT OF GASSES IN EARTH?S INTERIOR. RESEARCH EFFORTS OF THIS PROJECT CENTER ON EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS OF HOW THE HALOGEN ELEMENTS TRACE THE PATH OF FLUIDS THROUGH SUBDUCTION ZONES AND MODIFY THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF WATER-RICH FLUIDS AT DEPTH. EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS OF THIS PROJECT INCLUDE DEVELOPING CURRICULA TO BETTER ENGAGE STUDENTS INTERESTED IN STEM AND TRAINING STUDENTS IN CUTTING EDGE RESEARCH TECHNIQUES AT THE GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE LEVEL. THIS PROJECT WILL SUPPORT THREE SPECIFIC RESEARCH TASKS. THE FIRST TASK IS TO EXPERIMENTALLY MEASURE THE ELEMENTAL PARTITIONING OF HALOGENS BETWEEN SLAB MINERALS AND WATER-RICH FLUIDS UNDER APPLICABLE PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE CONDITIONS. THESE DATA WILL BE APPLIED TOWARDS PREDICTING THE HALOGEN CHEMISTRY OF FLUIDS AND RESIDUAL MINERALS FOR DIFFERENT SLAB CONDITIONS. PREDICTIONS WILL THEN BE COMPARED TO OBSERVATIONS FROM ARC VOLCANOES AND MANTLE SOURCES TO CONSTRAIN HOW HALOGENS ARE MOBILIZED THROUGH SUBDUCTION ZONES. THE SECOND TASK IS TO MEASURE HOW EFFICIENTLY CHLORINE INCREASES THE SOLUTE CONCENTRATIONS OF WATER-RICH FLUIDS UNDER CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO SLAB-FLUID INTERACTIONS. THE COLLECTED DATA WILL INFORM HOW THE CHEMISTRY OF SUBDUCTION ZONE FLUIDS ARE DETERMINED. THE THIRD TASK IS TO QUANTIFY HOW THE FLUID-SATURATED MELTING POINT OF ROCKS IS INCREASED BY THE ADDITION OF CHLORINE. RESULTS WILL BE APPLIED TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING THE THERMAL STRUCTURE OF SUBDUCTION ZONES AND THE ASSOCIATED PROPENSITY FOR SLAB MELTING. THE COMBINED EFFORTS OF THE RESEARCH TASKS WILL YIELD A SYSTEMATIC INVESTIGATION FOR HOW HALOGENS TRACE AND MODIFY MASS TRANSFER IN SUBDUCTION SETTINGS. THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO SUPPORT MAJOR EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS. THE FIRST IS TO DEVELOP AN INTRODUCTORY CLASS FOCUSED ON PLANETARY SCIENCE. THE CLASS WILL BE OFFERED THROUGH THE TULANE SCIENCE SCHOLARS PROGRAM, A PROGRAM THAT TARGETS SOUTHERN LOUISIANA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND ENABLES A DIVERSE COHORT OF ~150 STUDENTS TO TAKE A STEM CLASS OVER THE SUMMER FOR COLLEGE CREDIT. NO GEOSCIENCES CLASS IS CURRENTLY OFFERED THROUGH THIS PROGRAM, AND THE NEWLY DEVELOPED PLANETARY SCIENCE CLASS WILL FILL THIS CRUCIAL HOLE IN THE CURRENT CURRICULUM. THE SECOND IS TO REVAMP THE LABORATORY ACTIVITIES OF THE EARTH MATERIALS CLASS AT TULANE TO INTRODUCE STUDENTS TO A WIDE RANGE OF ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES COMMONLY APPLIED WITHIN GEOCHEMISTRY. THE IMPACT OF THIS REVAMPING WILL BE ENHANCED BY PARTNERING WITH OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT TEACH EARTH MATERIALS COURSES TO HELP REFINE THE LABORATORY ACTIVITIES. THE REFINED ACTIVITIES WILL BE POSTED TO COMMUNITY REPOSITORIES FOR CURRICULA. THE THIRD EDUCATIONAL EFFORT WILL PROVIDE TRAINING FOR THREE PHD STUDENTS IN MATERIALS SYNTHESIS AND MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION TECHNIQUES. WITHIN THIS EFFORT, UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WILL BE RECRUITED FROM THE NEW ORLEANS METRO AREA TO JOIN THE RESEARCH EFFORTS.

UNTREATED POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION PRESENTS ACUTE AND LONG-TERM RISKS TO A MOTHER'S MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH, AS WELL AS HER CHILD'S SURVIVAL, HEALTH, AND DEVELOPMENT. ALTHOUGH THERE IS INCREASING WILLINGNESS AMONG FUNDERS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS TO INVOLVE NON- SPECIALISTS, SUCH AS COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS, IN THE DELIVERY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS FOR POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION, THE OUTCOMES OF THESE NON-SPECIALIST INTERVENTIONS HAVE BEEN MIXED. DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY, SPECIFICALLY THE USE OF PASSIVE SENSING DATA COLLECTION TO LEARN MORE ABOUT A MOTHER'S LIFE AND SUPPORT BEHAVIOR CHANGE, HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS DELIVERED BY NON-SPECIALISTS. FOR THE PROPOSED R21/R33, WE WILL BUILD ON PRELIMINARY DEVELOPMENT WORK OF SENSING TECHNOLOGIES FOR MATERNAL DEPRESSION TREATMENT IN LOW RESOURCE SETTINGS (STANDSTRONG) TO DEMONSTRATE FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND FUNCTIONALITY FOR POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION TREATMENT IN NEPAL. STANDSTRONG IS A DIGITAL PLATFORM CONSISTING OF TWO MOBILE APPS, INTERNET-OF-THINGS (IOT) PASSIVE SENSORS, AND A DATA ANALYSIS ENGINE BUILT USING MODERN MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES. STANDSTRONG INCORPORATES PASSIVE SENSING DATA COLLECTION FROM MOTHERS AND THEIR INFANTS THAT CAN BE MONITORED BY NON-SPECIALIST COUNSELORS AND THEN INCORPORATED TO BETTER PERSONALIZE PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENT. FOR AIM 1 (R21 PHASE), WE WILL USE HUMAN-CENTERED DESIGN TO ITERATIVELY REFINE THE STANDSTRONG PLATFORM AND ASSOCIATED IMPLEMENTATION MATERIAL. FOR AIM 2 (R21 PHASE), WE WILL EVALUATE THE STANDSTRONG PLATFORM AND ASSOCIATED CONTENTS ACCORDING TO ACCEPTABILITY, FEASIBILITY, USAGE, BENEFIT, AND VALIDITY.

CLINICAL OUTCOMES ARE DICTATED LARGELY BY THE DEXTROSE AND SODIUM CONCENTRATIONS USED IN EACH TREATMENT. HOWEVER, THE FLEXIBILITY OF APD SYSTEMS IS WOEFULLY DEFICIENT. WHILE THE BENEFITS OF LIMITING GLUCOSE EXPOSURE TO EXTEND THE LIFE OF THE PERITONEUM ARE KNOWN, NO APD DEVICE ALLOWS USERS TO DELIVER A GRADUALLY DECREASING DEXTROSE CONCENTRATION. RECENT EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT HYPERTENSIVE PD PATIENTS COULD BENEFIT FROM A CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE REDUCED DIALYSATE SODIUM ADMIXTURE TO REMOVE EXCESS SODIUM FROM THE BLOOD AND IMPROVE BLOOD PRESSURE. THE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED ADVANCED AMERICAN KIDNEY HEALTH INITIATIVE (AAKHI) CALLS FOR 80% OF NEW ESRD PATIENTS IN 2025 TO RECEIVE HOME DIALYSIS OR A TRANSPLANT, WHICH WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE FROM 10% TO ~50% OF DIALYSIS PATIENTS USING PD.

LABED PROJECT SUMMARY  THE HIGHLY ADDICTIVE PROPERTIES OF OPIOID DRUGS, COUPLED WITH ROUTINE OVER-PRESCRIPTION, HAVE RESULTED IN A NATIONAL CRISIS. ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE BY OPIOIDS HAS INCREASED OVER 400% IN THE LAST 15 YEARS, FROM ~8,000 OPIOID- RELATED OVERDOSES TO MORE THAN 30,000 IN 2015. THE STAGGERING COST OF THE OPIOID HEALTH CRISIS TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC EXCEEDS $50 BILLION ANNUALLY, HIGHLIGHTING THE NEED FOR SAFER THERAPEUTICS FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT. DRS. KIRILL MARTEMYANOV AND BROCK GRILL AT THE SCRIPPS INSTITUTE, FLORIDA, HAVE ENGINEERED A MODEL SYSTEM EXPRESSING A FUNCTIONAL MAMMALIAN OPIOID RECEPTOR (MOR) IN THE MODEL NEMATODE CAENORHABDITIS ELEGANS FOR DISCOVERY OF OPIOID MODULATORS. USING THIS SYSTEM, THEY IDENTIFIED AN ORPHAN G PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTOR, GPR139, AS A NEGATIVE REGULATOR OF MOR SIGNALING. IN MAMMALS, GPR139 IS CO-EXPRESSED WITH MOR IN OPIOID-SENSITIVE BRAIN REGIONS AND INFLUENCES MOR TRAFFICKING AND SIGNALING. DELETION OF GPR139 IN MICE ENHANCED OPIOID-INDUCED INHIBITION OF NEURONAL FIRING, INCREASED THE ANALGESIC AND REWARDING EFFECTS OF MORPHINE, AND REDUCED WITHDRAWAL.  PREVIOUS EFFORTS TO TARGET GPR139, WHICH HAVE LARGELY FOCUSED ON IDENTIFICATION OF SMALL MOLECULE AGONISTS, HAS FAILED TO PRODUCE A THERAPEUTIC CANDIDATE ANTAGONIST WITH FAVORABLE PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES. TO ADDRESS THIS UNMET NEED, EVODENOVO WILL SCREEN AN INNOVATIVE LIBRARY OF CYCLIC PEPTIDES (CPS) FOR NEW GPR139 ANTAGONISTS BY COMBINING TWO STATE-OF-THE-ART C. ELEGANS TECHNOLOGIES EXCLUSIVE TO EVODENOVO: 1) INVIVO DISPLAY: A HIGH-THROUGHPUT SCREENING TECHNOLOGY INVENTED BY EVODENOVO THAT CAN BE USED FOR PEPTIDE-BASED DRUG DISCOVERY THAT BYPASSES THE NECESSITY OF PEPTIDE PURIFICATION BY DIRECTLY FEEDING LIVE RECOMBINANT E. COLI CLONES, EACH EXPRESSING A DIFFERENT CYCLIC PEPTIDE, DIRECTLY TO NEMATODES EXPRESSING MAMMALIAN MOR AND HUMAN GP139. THIS DRASTICALLY REDUCES THE COST AND TIME FOR SCREENING. 2) THE ANTI-OPIOID BEHAVIOR PLATFORM DEVELOPED AT SCRIPPS BY DRS. MARTEMYANOV AND GRIL THAT ASSESSES THE BEHAVIORAL EFFECTS OF OPIOIDS AND IDENTIFIES PHARMACOLOGICAL OUTCOMES OF DIFFERENT DRUGS. THE COMBINATION OF BOTH PLATFORMS, ASSISTED BY AN AUTOMATED C. ELEGANS MOVEMENT TRACKING SYSTEM, WILL YIELD A POWERFUL HIGH THROUGHPUT SCREENING ENGINE CAPABLE OF INTERROGATING THOUSANDS OF RECOMBINANT PEPTIDES WITHIN A FEW DAYS, ALL IN A UNIQUE IN VIVO SETUP. GPR139 ANTAGONISTS IDENTIFIED USING THIS ASSAY WOULD LIKELY BE MISSED BY CONVENTIONAL SCREENING PROTOCOLS. EVODENOVO USES CPS INSTEAD OF LINEAR PEPTIDES. THE CYCLIZATION OF PEPTIDES INCREASES GUT STABILITY BY ELIMINATING VULNERABLE N- AND C-TERMINI, REDUCES SUSCEPTIBILITY TO PROTEOLYTIC HYDROLYSIS, AND ENHANCES MEMBRANE PERMEABILITY.  THERE ARE 2 SPECIFIC AIMS: AIM 1: PERFORM A BEHAVIORAL SCREEN FOR CYCLIC PEPTIDE ANTAGONISTS OF GPR139 IN C. ELEGANS. AIM 2: VALIDATE HITS GENERATED FROM THE C. ELEGANS PLATFORM IN MAMMALIAN CELL-BASED ASSAYS.

IN SOME MATERIALS THIS TRANSFORMATION IS REVERSIBLE, SO THAT THE MATERIAL CAN REPEATEDLY TRANSFORM BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN TWO SHAPES, GIVING RISE TO THE PROPERTY OF ?SHAPE MEMORY?. IN A MARTENSITIC CERAMIC LIKE ZIRCONIA, THE SHAPE CHANGE IS VERY LARGE (ELONGATING AND CONTRACTING A SHAPE BY ~10%) AND IT ALSO EXERTS VERY LARGE FORCES. FOR THIS REASON, SHAPE MEMORY MATERIALS ARE LIKE ?SOLID-STATE ENGINES?, ABLE TO DO WORK ON THEIR SURROUNDINGS AS ACTUATORS. WHAT IS MORE, IT HAS BEEN RECENTLY DISCOVERED THAT SHAPE MEMORY ZIRCONIA CAN BE TRANSFORMED BY APPLYING ELECTRIC FIELDS TO IT, WHICH OPENS THE DOOR TO ELECTRONIC CONTROL OVER SHAPE MEMORY. WITH SUPPORT FROM THE CERAMICS PROGRAM IN THE DIVISION OF MATERIALS RESEARCH, THIS PROJECT INVESTIGATES THE NEW PROPERTY OF ELECTRICAL SHAPE MEMORY IN CERAMICS AND DEVELOPS TOOLS TO DISCOVER AND DESIGN NEW CERAMIC MATERIALS THAT EXHIBIT THIS PROPERTY. THE PROJECT CONSISTS OF COMPUTATIONAL AND THEORETICAL EFFORTS TO UNDERSTAND HOW DIFFERENT PARAMETERS AFFECT THE MARTENSITIC TRANSFORMATION, LED BY PROF. HOMER AT BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY, AND AN EXPERIMENTAL EFFORT TO VALIDATE THE PHASE TRANSFORMATION THEORY FOR DIFFERENT ORIENTATIONS OF THE CRYSTALS, TEMPERATURES, AND APPLIED ELECTRIC FIELDS. THIS RESEARCH TO SYNTHESIZE AND TEST NEW PROSPECTIVE SHAPE MEMORY CERAMICS IS CARRIED OUT IN PROF. SCHUH?S RESEARCH GROUP AT THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY. THIS RESEARCH HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR ACTUATOR DEVICE TECHNOLOGIES, WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN AS EASILY MINIATURIZED AS OTHER ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGIES. ADDITIONALLY, THE PROJECT WILL ALSO PROVIDE SCIENTIFIC TRAINING FOR TWO PHD STUDENTS, ONE AT EACH INSTITUTION, AND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES WILL INVOLVE A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT TO STRENGTHEN THE ROLL OUT OF A MATERIALS SCIENCE MINOR PROGRAM AT BYU TO UNIFY MATERIALS-ORIENTED STUDENTS THAT ARE SPREAD ACROSS DIFFERENT MAJORS ON CAMPUS. TECHNICAL SUMMARY SUPPORTED BY THE CERAMICS PROGRAM IN THE DIVISION OF MATERIALS RESEARCH, THIS PROJECT INVESTIGATES A NEW CLASS OF SHAPE MEMORY CERAMICS IN WHICH THE CLASSICAL ADVANTAGES OF SHAPE MEMORY (THE ABILITY TO DO LARGE AMOUNTS OF MECHANICAL WORK THROUGH A SOLID STATE PHASE TRANSFORMATION) ARE PAIRED WITH A NEW MECHANISM FOR ACTIVATING THAT PROPERTY (AN ELECTRIC FIELD-DRIVEN PARAELECTRIC-TO-PARAELECTRIC PHASE TRANSFORMATION). BESIDES DEVELOPING AN ENTIRELY NEW CLASS OF ?PARAELECTROACTIVE? CERAMICS THAT CAN PERFORM MEANINGFUL MECHANICAL WORK AND EXPANDING THE PORTFOLIO OF ELECTROACTIVE CERAMICS, THE RESEARCH ALSO HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE THEORY OF PHASE TRANSFORMATIONS MORE BROADLY. THE RESEARCH INVOLVES FOUR INTERRELATED TASKS: (1) DEVELOPING AND VALIDATING THERMODYNAMIC MODELS THAT INCORPORATE THE COUPLED INFLUENCE OF ELECTRICAL-THERMAL-MECHANICAL ENERGY ON A PARAELECTRIC-TO-PARAELECTRIC MARTENSITIC TRANSFORMATION; (2) EXAMINING THE ROLE OF CRYSTAL ORIENTATION AND ANISOTROPIC MATERIAL PROPERTIES ON THE PREDICTED AND OBSERVED PHASE TRANSFORMATION CONDITIONS; (3) EXPLORING THE ROLE OF DOPANTS TO CONTROL THE TRANSFORMATION CONDITIONS AND ENABLE ROOM TEMPERATURE OPERATION OF THIS PHENOMENON; (4) EXPANDING THE MATERIALS-SCOPE OF THE PHENOMENON BY DISCOVERING ALTERNATIVE (NON-ZIRCONIA) SHAPE MEMORY CERAMICS THAT EXHIBIT PARAELECTRIC-PARAELECTRIC MARTENSITIC TRANSFORMATIONS. THESE TASKS ARE COLLABORATIVELY INVESTIGATED WITH A PRIMARILY EXPERIMENTAL EFFORT IN PROF. SCHUH?S RESEARCH GROUP AT THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND PROF.

THE DIESEL ENGINE WILL BE CERTIFIED TO EPA TIER III REQUIREMENTS THUS ACHIEVING REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ABOVE THOSE ACHIEVED THROUGH REMANUFACTURING OF LOCOMOTIVES. THE PROJECT IS PROPOSED BASED ON THE SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION OF THIS CONCEPT TO FREIGHT LOCOMOTIVES USED IN MAIN LINE FREIGHT SERVICE. GC4502: LOCOMOTIVE IDLE REDUCTION. THIS PROJECT CONSISTS OF THE PURCHASE AND INSTALLATION OF A CONTROL SYSTEM THAT WILL AUTOMATICALLY SHUT DOWN THE DIESEL ENGINES ON 24 F40PH MODEL LOCOMOTIVES DURING PERIODS WHEN THE ENGINES ARE IDLING CONSISTENTLY SUCH AS WHEN THEY ARE AWAITING DISPATCHING ORDERS OR ARE QUEUED UP IN A YARD. AUTOMATIC SHUT-DOWN/START-UP TECHNOLOGY MONITORS THE LOCOMOTIVE AND AUTOMATICALLY SHUTS THE ENGINE DOWN WHEN A CERTAIN SET OF PARAMETERS HAVE BEEN MET AND RESTARTS THE ENGINE UNDER OTHER PARAMETERS. METRA HAS ELECTED TO OBTAIN AN EPA-VERIFIED TECHNOLOGY TO REDUCE ENGINE IDLE TIME. THE AUTOMATIC SHUT-DOWN/START-UP TECHNOLOGY MONITORS THE LOCOMOTIVE AND AUTOMATICALLY SHUTS THE ENGINE DOWN WHEN A CERTAIN SET OF PARAMETERS HAVE BEEN MET. IT ENABLES THE RESTART OF THE ENGINE UNDER ALTERNATIVE PARAMETERS. USING AN EPA EMISSIONS QUANTIFIER A PROGRAM THAT CALCULATES THE REDUCTION IN EMISSIONS METRA HAS FOUND THE USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE NITROGEN OXIDES (NOX) PARTICULATE MATTER (PM) CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) AND DIESEL FUEL CONSUMPTION.GC4602: HOTEL POWER MODIFICATION. THIS PROJECT WILL MODIFY FIVE LOCOMOTIVES BY REPLACING THE MAIN ENGINE DRIVEN GENERATOR INVERTER COMBINATION THAT PROVIDES HOTEL POWER FOR THE TRAIN CONSIST WITH A SEPARATE ENGINE/GENERATOR SET FOR HOTEL POWER ON FIVE OF METRAS MODEL MP36 PASSENGER LOCOMOTIVES CURRENTLY ASSIGNED TO BNSF SERVICE. THIS WILL SAVE FUEL AND REDUCE EMISSIONS.DURING NORMAL OPERATION THERE ARE PERIODS WHEN THE LOCOMOTIVES MUST PROVIDE HOTEL POWER TO A TRAIN CONSIST WITHOUT CARRYING PASSENGERS SUCH AS WHEN A TRAIN IS STANDING IN A YARD. TO DO THIS THE ENGINE IS RUNNING NOT JUST IDLING. WITH AN ENGINE/GENERATOR SET THE MAIN ENGINE SPEED CAN BE SET TO IDLE INSTEAD THUS SAVING FUEL AND REDUCING EXHAUST EMISSIONS. THE ENGINE/GENERATOR SET WILL BE CERTIFIED TO EPA TIER III OR POSSIBLY TIER IV. THIS WILL FURTHER REDUCE EMISSIONS.DESCRIPTIONS BY A.L.I. LINE-ITEM DESCRIPTIONS ARE PROVIDED BELOW.

TO COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY, EFFICIENTLY, AND SECURELY AT ALL TIMES, IT IS CRITICAL TO HAVE THE ABILITY OF OPERATING THROUGH UNTRUSTED INDIGENOUS INFRASTRUCTURE AND AT THE SAME TIME, SEAMLESSLY AND SECURELY CONNECT WITH DEVICES ON TRUSTED NETWORKS. WITH THE GROWING THREAT LANDSCAPE AND ATTACK SURFACES IN 5G COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, A PROMISING APPROACH TO TACKLE THE SECURITY CHALLENGES IS TO ADOPT A HOLISTIC ZERO TRUST APPROACH BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF ?NEVER TRUST, ALWAYS VERIFY?. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO ACHIEVE TRUSTWORTHY COMMUNICATIONS OVER UNTRUSTED AND POTENTIALLY COMPROMISED 5G NETWORKS BY CREATING END-TO-END SECURITY INTELLIGENCE. THE PROJECT TEAM COMPRISING OF EXPERTS FROM ACADEMIA, INDUSTRY, AND ACADEMIC-INDUSTRY PARTNERSHIPS, WILL ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SOFTWARE-BASED SOLUTION FOR AUTOMATED AND TRUSTWORTHY NETWORK ORCHESTRATION ALLOWING MILITARY AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OPERATORS TO SECURELY COMMUNICATE USING COMMERCIAL 5G NETWORKS. THE PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP CAPABILITIES THAT ENABLE MILITARY AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PERSONNEL TO SECURELY COMMUNICATE USING BOTH MILITARY AND MODERN COMMERCIAL 5G INFRASTRUCTURE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, WITHOUT THE RISK OF BEING BREACHED OR HACKED. THE DEVELOPED TOOLS WILL ENHANCE THE CAPABILITIES OF TACTICAL NETWORKS IN ENFORCING ZERO TRUST AND POLICY-BASED ACCESS MANAGEMENT OF TACTICAL UNITS. FURTHERMORE, THE CONVERGENCE TEAM WILL DEVELOP A CROSS-DISCIPLINARY CURRICULUM FOR TRAINING AND EDUCATION OF NEXT-GENERATION WORKFORCE ON ZERO TRUST FOR 5G NETWORKS. SPECIAL EMPHASIS WILL BE PLACED ON RECRUITING UNDER-REPRESENTED MINORITY STUDENTS IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF SECURE 5G NETWORKS. THIS PROJECT WILL INTEGRATE CROSS-DISCIPLINARY EXPERTISE FROM TRUSTWORTHY SYSTEM DESIGN, MACHINE LEARNING/ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, AND 5G NETWORKS & EDGE COMPUTING TO ACCELERATE THE AUTOMATED CREATION OF AN OVERLAY OF PROACTIVE, END-TO-END ZERO-TRUST SECURITY AND RESILIENCE MECHANISM OVER THE TACTICAL 5G NETWORK CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE. THE CONVERGENCE RESEARCH IS CENTERED AROUND THREE MAIN THRUSTS. THRUST 1 WILL FOCUS ON THE DYNAMIC AND PROACTIVE TRUST EVALUATION OF TACTICAL DEVICES IN THE NETWORK. A DISTRIBUTED AND AUTONOMOUS APPROACH WILL BE USED TO COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT DEVICE INTERACTIONS, LEVERAGE TRIGGERS, AND INDICATORS TO MAKE QUANTITATIVE TRUST ASSESSMENTS. THRUST 2 WILL USE THE TRUST INFORMATION OBTAINED IN THRUST 1 TO ORCHESTRATE NETWORK RESOURCES ACCORDING TO TACTICAL MISSION SCENARIOS AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF DIFFERENT END-TO-END PATHS. IT WILL BE ACHIEVED USING A DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING APPROACH BY ITERATIVELY OBTAINING ACCESS PERMISSIONS FROM A NOVEL TRUST MANAGEMENT ENGINE AND PROVIDING IT WITH RESOURCE SELECTION DECISIONS. THRUST 3 WILL AUTOMATE THE ACCESS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO PROACTIVELY THWART UNQUALIFIED ACCESS TO CRITICAL RESOURCES AND PREVENT LATERAL MOVEMENT OF ATTACKS AND MALWARE. THE TOOLS DEVELOPED AS A RESULT OF THIS PROJECT WILL BE ORIENTED TOWARD OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS IN TACTICAL MISSIONS.

THE NEED THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED IS WITHIN TA 2.4.2.3: IN-SPACE TANK-TO-TANK PROPELLANT TRANSFER [1]. HUMAN MARS MISSIONS WILL REQUIRE EFFICIENT DELIVERY OF CRYOGENS FROM A SUPPLY TANK TO A RECEIVER TANK IN MICROGRAVITY. AS NOTED IN THE NASA SSTIP  STORAGE AND TRANSFER OF CRYOGENS IN SPACE IS CRITICAL FOR DEEP SPACE HUMAN EXPLORATION  MAKING IT ONE OF THE SIX NRC HIGH PRIORITIES WITHIN THE  LAUNCH AND IN-SPACE PROPULSION  CORE TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT. THE HIGH PERFORMANCE OFFERED BY THE CRYOGENIC PROPULSION WILL PERMIT LONGER RANGE MISSIONS  LARGER PAYLOAD MASSES  AND REDUCE HUMAN EXPOSURE TIME TO SPACE ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS. IN-SPACE TANK-TO-TANK TRANSFER IS COMPOSED OF THREE OPERATIONAL ELEMENTS   1) HIGH EFFICIENCY LINE CHILLDOWN  2) HIGH EFFICIENCY TANK CHILLDOWN  AND 3) NO-VENT FILL OF THE RECEIVER TANK. WHEN TRANSFERRING CRYOGEN FROM A SUPPLY TANK TO A RECEIVER TANK  THE TRANSFER LINE (I.E. PIPE AND VALVES) AND RECEIVER TANK ARE AT HIGH TEMPERATURES COMPARED TO THAT OF THE LIQUID PROPELLANT. CHILLDOWN IS THE PROCESS OF INTRODUCING THE CRYOGEN INTO THE SYSTEM TO COOL THE HARDWARE DOWN TO THE LIQUID TEMPERATURE. THE FLOWING PROPELLANT BOILS OFF AS IT COOLS THE LINE AND TANK. SINCE THE PROPELLANT IS ONLY STORABLE AND USEFUL TO THE ENGINE IN PURE LIQUID FORM  THIS VAPORIZED PROPELLANT IS VENTED OVERBOARD AND CONSIDERED  LOST . SINCE EACH OF THE THREE ELEMENTS IS A TWO-PHASE FLOW PROCESS  THEY ARE ALL HIGHLY INFLUENCED BY THE GRAVITY LEVEL. THE PI S GROUP HAS PREVIOUSLY PERFORMED MANY TERRESTRIAL CHILLDOWN AND MICROGRAVITY PARABOLIC FLIGHT CHILLDOWN EXPERIMENTS FOR PIPES. MORE DIFFICULT TO MODEL AND IN MOST CASES MORE IMPORTANT FOR THE PROPELLANT THERMAL MANAGEMENT IS THE CHILLDOWN OF THE RECEIVER TANK. THE RECEIVER TANK IS THE MOST MASSIVE COMPONENT OF THE SYSTEM TO BE CHILLED DOWN AND  THEREFORE  TAKES MUCH MORE TIME TO CHILL DOWN AND THUS MORE CRYOGEN CONSUMPTION. AS A RESULT  THE TIME AND PROPELLANT SPENT DURING CHILLDOWN WILL MOSTLY BE DICTATED BY HOW FAST THE TANK CAN BE CHILLED DOWN. BUT AT THIS TIME THERE HAVE BEEN NO STUDIES ON TANK CHILLDOWN IN ZERO GRAVITY. PREVIOUS TANK CHILLDOWN STUDIES HAVE BEEN LIMITED TO JUST 1G CONDITIONS AND WERE VERY SCARCE WITH ONLY TWO DATA SETS AVAILABLE AND THE EXPERIMENTS WERE POORLY EXECUTED [2]. THE PROPOSED PROJECT SEEKS TO FILL THIS VOID AND CLOSE THIS GAP BY CONDUCTING REDUCED GRAVITY EXPERIMENT FOR CRYOGENIC CHILLDOWN OF A RECEIVER TANK IN REDUCED GRAVITY  ANALYZING DATA  DEVELOPING MODELS  AND THEN SUGGEST OPTIMAL TANK CHILLDOWN METHODS.

ADVANCES IN INFORMATION SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS FOR GREATER INTERACTION ACROSS ORGANIZATIONAL BOUNDARIES INCLUDING DYNAMIC RESPONSE TO EMERGENT EVENTS. REMOTE SENSING OF CONVECTIVE STORM SYSTEMS WILL BENEFIT FROM RESPONSIVE OPERATIONS TO IDENTIFY AND MONITOR CLOUD DYNAMICS AND CONVECTIVE PROCESSES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE FORMATION AND EVOLUTION OF STORM SYSTEMS AND THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AT REGIONAL AND GLOBAL SCALES. FUTURE OBSERVING SYSTEMS WITH INTER-AGENCY  INTERNATIONAL  AND COMMERCIAL PARTNERS CONSTITUTE A SYSTEM-OF-SYSTEMS BECAUSE EACH PARTNER PURSUES THEIR OWN OBJECTIVES ON DIFFERENT DEVELOPMENT TIMELINES. SYSTEM-OF-SYSTEMS ARCHITECTING FOLLOWS MORE INDIRECT PRINCIPLES SUCH AS IDENTIFYING STABLE INTERMEDIATE FORMS AND EXERTING LEVERAGE AT THE INTERFACES. CO-SIMULATION IS AN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR DESIGN  EVALUATION  AND MATURATION OF SYSTEM-OF-SYSTEMS CONCEPTS THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM LIFECYCLE. IT PROVIDES DISTRIBUTED CONTROL OVER CONSTITUENT SYSTEMS AND ALLOWS PARTNERS TO INTEGRATE CONSTITUENT SIMULATORS DESPITE DIFFERENCES IN MODELING FRAMEWORKS AND LANGUAGES OR OTHER INFORMATION SHARING BARRIERS DUE TO LEGAL OR PROPRIETARY ISSUES. APPLIED TO CONVECTIVE STORM OBSERVING SYSTEMS  CO-SIMULATION DEMONSTRATES AND VALIDATES NEW OPERATIONAL CONCEPTS SUCH AS ING  SCHEDULING  AND DYNAMIC POINTING ACROSS ORGANIZATIONAL BOUNDARIES. A CO-SIMULATION PLATFORM INTEGRATES SIMULATION MODELS OF MISSION AND PARTNER NODES THROUGH A LOOSELY COUPLED SERVICE-ORIENTED ARCHITECTURE. FRONT-END MISSION DESIGN ACTIVITIES PROPOSE NEW MISSION CONCEPTS BY VARYING THE NUMBER OF SATELLITES  ORBITAL GEOMETRY  AND INSTRUMENT CHARACTERISTICS. CO-SIMULATION EXECUTES A JOINT SCENARIO BY COORDINATING MEMBER SIMULATOR EXECUTION ACROSS AN INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE. FINALLY  A BACK-END SCIENCE EVALUATION ENGINE MAPS COLLECTED SCENARIO OBSERVATIONS TO A MEASURE OF SCIENTIFIC UTILITY TO EVALUATE EFFECTIVENESS. TO ACHIEVE PROJECT GOALS  THIS PROJECT PROPOSES THREE MAJOR RESEARCH THRUSTS BUILDING ON PRIOR AND CURRENT EFFORTS WITHIN THE EARTH SCIENCE COMMUNITY. THE FIRST THRUST DEVELOPS MISSION AND SCIENCE NODES TO MODEL OBSERVATION OF CONVECTIVE STORM SYSTEMS AND CORRESPONDING SCIENTIFIC UTILITY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A SINGLE MISSION DIRECTOR FOR INITIAL VALIDATION. THE SECOND THRUST TRANSITIONS MISSION NODES TO A CO-SIMULATION PLATFORM TO EVALUATE COLLABORATIVE MISSION OPERATIONS WITH PARTNER NODES AND STATIC INTERACTIONS TO COMPOSE OBSERVATIONS ACROSS MULTIPLE ELEMENTS. FINALLY  THE THIRD THRUST INVESTIGATES DYNAMIC INTERACTIONS BETWEEN MISSION PARTNERS TO EXCHANGE INFORMATION DURING OPERATIONS TO SCHEDULE INSTRUMENT POINTING AND MONITOR EMERGENT CONVECTIVE STORM SYSTEMS. SCIENCE EVALUATION EVALUATES AND QUANTIFIES THE BENEFIT OF PARTNERSHIPS AND NEW TECHNOLOGY TO INFORM FUTURE INVESTMENT. PROJECT OBJECTIVES ALIGN WITH TWO MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THE 2017 EARTH SCIENCE DECADAL SURVEY. EMPHASIZING THE ROLE OF PARTNERSHIPS IN OBSERVING SYSTEMS  THIS PROJECT ADVANCES DATA SCIENCE AND  SPECIFICALLY  CO-SIMULATION DATA ARCHITECTURES TO FACILITATE COLLABORATION FOR DESIGN AND PLANNING OF NEW OBSERVATION STRATEGIES. ON A LONGER TIMESCALE  THIS PROJECT EVALUATES NEW COLLABORATIVE MISSION CONCEPTS CAPABLE OF COORDINATING AND COLLECTING REMOTE SENSING DATA TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL UNDERSTANDING AND MODEL REPRESENTATIONS OF DYNAMICAL PROCESSES IN CONVECTIVE STORMS.

THE ADVENT OF TARGETED DRUG DELIVERY HAS LED TO SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN NANO-MEDICINE AND PATIENTS' CARE. IN THIS CLINICAL PROCESS, A CARRIER TRANSPORTS AND RELEASES DRUGS AT A SPECIFIC SITE, THUS MINIMIZING NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS ON HEALTHY CELLS AND TISSUES. TO OPTIMIZE DELIVERY, THE CARRIER IS OFTEN DIRECTED USING VARIOUS METHODS, INCLUDING TECHNOLOGIES THAT MIMIC THE PROPULSION OF MICROORGANISMS. THIS INTERDISCIPLINARY PROJECT WILL LAY THE FOUNDATIONS FOR AN INTEGRATED TARGETED DRUG DELIVERY FRAMEWORK. IT COMBINES BIOLOGY, COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCES, MATHEMATICS, AND PHYSICS TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES AND CONDITIONS FOR OPTIMIZING THE CARRIER'S PATH AND RELEASE. THE RESEARCH RESULTS WILL PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO THE WAYS CARRIERS CAN BE CONTROLLED TO SAFELY ADMINISTER DRUGS. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO SUPPORT AND HELP TO TRAIN STUDENTS IN ALL STEM FIELDS. THE PI WILL USE PROBLEMS FROM THIS RESEARCH TO DEVELOP PROJECT-BASED COURSES THAT PROVIDE TOWSON UNIVERSITY STUDENTS WITH HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE IN RESEARCH. UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS WILL ACTIVELY BE RECRUITED AND ENCOURAGED TO TAKE LEADING ROLES IN THE PROJECT. THESE STUDENTS WILL BENEFIT FROM YEAR-ROUND EXPOSURE TO ADVANCED MATHEMATICAL METHODS AND INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER RESEARCHERS, HELPING THEM TO GROW MORE CONFIDENT IN THEIR SCIENCE IDENTITY. AS A RESULT, THIS PROJECT WILL DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTE TO INCREASING THE REPRESENTATION OF UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS IN GRADUATE SCHOOLS AND OTHER STEM CAREERS. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO IMPACT TOWSON UNIVERSITY BY PROVIDING MORE OPPORTUNITIES IN APPLIED RESEARCH FOR MOTIVATED STUDENTS. THESE OPPORTUNITIES WILL FURTHER RAISE TOWSON UNIVERSITY'S PROFILE IN THE BALTIMORE REGION AND TURN IT INTO AN ATTRACTIVE DESTINATION FOR CUTTING-EDGE TRANSFORMATIVE RESEARCH IN THE MATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES. THE PROJECT FITS INTO A COMPLEX, MULTIPART, AND MULTISCALE DYNAMIC SYSTEM THAT WILL CAPTURE THE FUNDAMENTALS OF TARGETED DRUG DELIVERY. THE GOAL IS TO DEVELOP A NEW MATHEMATICAL/COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE SWIMMING OF MICROORGANISMS ENCLOSED IN A SOFT PARTICLE IN DC ELECTRIC FIELD USING PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS, FLUID DYNAMICS, AND NUMERICAL METHODS INCLUDING NEURAL NETWORKS. AS A FIRST STEP, AN IDEALIZED REPRESENTATION OF A PROPELLING CILIATED MICROORGANISM ENCLOSED IN A SURFACTANT-COVERED DROP IN A DC ELECTRIC FIELD WILL BE USED TO DESCRIBE THE DIRECTED MOTION OF A DRUG CARRIER IN AN ELECTRIFIED MEDIUM. ANALYTICAL AND NUMERICAL TOOLS WILL HELP TO PROBE AND SOLVE THE PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS THAT GOVERN THE PROBLEM, INCLUDING SPHEROIDAL HARMONICS, ASYMPTOTIC ANALYSES, AND MACHINE LEARNING. SPECIFICALLY, FOR CONDITIONS BEYOND THE ANALYTICAL MODELS' RANGE OF VALIDITY, SOLUTIONS WILL BE APPROXIMATED NUMERICALLY USING PHYSICS-INFORMED NEURAL NETWORKS. THE MODELS AND TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED HEREIN HAVE INTRINSIC MATHEMATICAL MERIT, ARISING FROM CONTEMPORARY INTERDISCIPLINARY APPLICATIONS SUCH AS MICROROBOTS PROPULSION AND MICROFLUIDICS. THEY ALSO EMBODY A BROAD SCOPE OF RESEARCH ACTIVITIES INCLUDING SWIMMING DYNAMICS OF BIOLOGICAL ORGANISMS AND ELECTROHYDRODYNAMICS OF SOFT PARTICLES.

FUNDING WAS COMPETITIVELY AWARDED UNDER THE FY 2021 BUSES AND BUS FACILITIES PROGRAM DISCRETIONARY ID D2022-BUSC-063PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS AWARD IS TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THE PURCHASE OF 4 REPLACEMENT VEHICLES WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING/CERTIFICATION OF MAINTENANCE.ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: 4 BUSES WILL BE REPLACED AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING/CERTIFICATION OF MAINTENANCE TECHNICIANS FOR LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GAS BUSES WILL BE PROVIDED.EXPECTED OUTCOMES: OVER 95% OF LPG IS PRODUCED IN NORTH AMERICA AND FUELS OVER 21 MILLION VEHICLES WORLDWIDE WITH JUST UNDER 300000 VEHICLES IN THE US ARE LPG FUELED. LPG HAS THE MOST ABUNDANT REFUELING INFRASTRUCTURE OF ANY ALTERNATIVE FUELS AND IS THE THIRD MOST COMMENT ENGINE FUEL BEHIND DIESEL AND GASOLINE. LPG IS STORED AT LOW PRESSURE REQUIRING MINIMAL ELECTRICAL POWER TO DISPENSE AS REQUIRED BY CNG OR ELECTRIC BUSES. IT HAS A NARROW FLAMMABILITY RANGE AND THE FUEL TANKS FOR LPG VEHICLES ARE 20 TIMES MORE PUNCTURE RESISTANT THAN GASOLINE FUELED VEHICLES. LPG IS READILY AVAILABLE ECONOMICAL SAFE AND AFFORDABLE FOR A CLEAN-BURNING ALTERNATIVE FUEL. HISTORICALLY LPG HAS BEEN LESS EXPENSIVE BY 30%-50% THAN GASOLINE AND WITHOUT THE HIGH INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS OF CNG AND/OR ELECTRIC EQUIPMENT. JUST BY BURNING A CLEANER FUEL IN THE ENGINE IS IN DIRECT CORRELATION TO LOWERING MAINTENANCE COSTS OF VEHICLES. HIGH MILEAGE VEHICLES VEHICLES THAT DRIVER 25-50000 MILES A YEAR SUCH AS ISLAND TRANSIT OFFER THE BIGGEST RETURN ON INVESTMENT IN MAINTENANCE COSTS ALONE. CURRENTLY ISLAND TRANSIT SPENDS AN ESTIMATED 52% OF ITS FTA APPORTIONMENT ON MAINTENANCE ALONE AND STILL REQUIRES ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE FROM STATE DOT FUNDS FOR MAINTENANCE COSTS. FOR FY 2022 ISLAND TRANSIT PROGRAMMED MAINTENANCE EXPENSE IS FORECASTED AT $1149875 WHICH WOULD INCLUDES FEDERAL FUNDS AND MATCHING REQUIREMENTS. BY TRANSITIONING TO LPG ISLAND TRANSIT EXPECTS TO REDUCE MAINTENANCE COSTS BY 20% THE FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION OF LPG BUSES. BY UTILIZING CLEANER AND THE THIRD MOST ABUNDANT FUEL AVAILABLE ISLAND TRANSIT WILL BEGIN THE TRANSITION TO A CLEANER AND GREEN BURNING FUEL IN LPG. ONE LGP VEHICLE ALONE WHEN COMPARED TO GASOLINE REDUCES GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) BY 24% REDUCES NITROGEN OXIDE (NOX) BY 20% AND REDUCES CARBON MONOXIDE (CO) BY 60 %. WHEN COMPARED TO DIESEL THERE IS 99% FEWER PARTICULATE EMISSIONS AND DPF IS COMPLETELY ELIMINATED. THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT WOULD BE IMMEDIATE WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LPG BUSES ON GALVESTON ISLAND. CARBON EMISSIONS WOULD BE REDUCED IN AN ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREA AFFECTING THE AIR QUALITY AND THE PUBLIC ESPECIALLY THOSE COMMUNITIES AND INDIVIDUALS THAT UTILIZE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. THE EJ POPULATION WOULD SEE AND FEEL THE IMPACT IMMEDIATELY AS WELL BUSES WITH LPG WITH THE EXPECTED REDUCTION IN EMISSIONS ALONE FROM CLEAN BURNING FUEL WOULD HAVE SUBSTANTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS. OVER 25% OF THE POPULATION ON GALVESTON ISLAND IS ESTIMATED NOT TO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE JUST BY UTILIZING A CLEANER BURNING BENEFITS THE COMMUNITIES SERVED BY REDUCING HEALTHCARE COSTS FROM POOR AIR QUALITY. LPG DOES NOT REQUIRE THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY TO STORE/DISPENSE AND MAINTAIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS REQUIRED FOR CNG OR ELECTRIC BUSES. AN ESTIMATED MEDIUM SIZE FLEET OF 50-80 UNITS WOULD REQUIRE APPROXIMATELY $700000-$900000 IN DIRECT INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS ALONE FOR CNG. FOR AN ELECTRIC FLEET THE COSTS ARE EVEN GREATER IN THE AREA OF $950000-$1.5 MILLION. THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY NECESSARY FOR STORAGE DISPENSING AND MAINTENANCE EXCEEDS THE COSTS OF LPG FUELED VEHICLES ALONE WITH THE COSTS FOR THE SAME MEDIUM SIZE FLEET ESTIMATED TO BE $50000-$80000 FOR LPG FUELED VEHICLES. WHILE THE MPG ON A LPG FUELED VEHICLE IS LESS THAN A GASOLINE VEHICLE DURING THE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE THE TOTAL LBS OF CO2 PRODUCE BY AN LPG FUELED VEHICLE IS 43450 LBS LESS THAN A GASOLINE FUELED VEHICLE. INTENDED BENEFICIARIES: THE IMPACT IS DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE TO THE COMMUNITIES SERVICED THAT ARE TRANSIT DEPENDENT THE ENVIRONMENT AND TO THE TRANSIT AGENCY ITSELF WITH A LOWER OPERATING COSTS AND A HEALTHIER WORKFORCE FROM CLEANER FUELED VEHICLES. SUBRECIPIENTS: NONELOCAL MATCH OF $187839 WILL BE FROM GALVESTON ISLAND TRANSIT CAPITAL FUNDS FUNDING THAT WAS SET ASIDE FOR FLEET REPLACEMENT AS PART OF THE LOCAL MATCH REQUIREMENTS. 85% FEDERAL MATCH WILL BE USED FOR BUS PURCHASES SINCE CLEANER FUEL VEHICLES WILL BE ACQUIRED. 80% FEDERAL MATCH WILL BE USED FOR TRAINING AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. GALVESTON ISLAND TRANSIT (GIT) AS PART OF THE H-GAC MSA OPERATES NOT ONLY IN AN AREA THAT IS IN NON-ATTAINMENT IN REGARDS TO CURRENT OZONE GUIDELINES BUT ALSO ON AN ISLAND THAT IS DESIGNATED AS AN ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREA. H-GAC AS PART OF THEIR COMPREHENSIVE PLAN VISION FOR TOMORROW 2035 H-GAC LIST MITIGATION STRATEGIES FOR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PROVIDERS TO REDUCE ADVERSE EFFECTS TO THE AIR QUALITY OF THE MSA. ALTERNATIVE FUELS FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION PROVIDERS IS ONE OF THE MAJOR HIGHLIGHTS OF THOSE MITIGATION STRATEGIES. THE CITY OF GALVESTON COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OF 2011 ALSO LISTS SEVERAL MITIGATION STRATEGIES TO ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC INTERESTS ARE MET WHILE PROTECTING AND PRESERVING THE NATURAL RESOURCES OF THE ISLAND. ISLAND TRANSIT HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPLEMENT THESE MITIGATION STRATEGIES BY IMPLEMENTING A BUS REPLACEMENT PROGRAM THAT UTILIZES ALTERNATIVE FUELS. ISLAND TRANSIT WILL BE REQUESTING FUNDING FOR 5-TRANSIT BUSES FUELED BY LPG. GALVESTON ISLAND TRANSIT CONSIDERED OTHER ALTERNATIVE FUELED FLEET REPLACEMENT SUCH AS ELECTRIC OR CNG (COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS). HOWEVER THE INITIAL INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS ARE SO PROHIBITIVE FOR SUCH A SMALL URBAN COMMUNITY SUCH AS CITY OF GALVESTON. AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE HIGH AND PROHIBITIVE INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS WAS LPG AND ITS MANY BENEFITS. LPG IS READILY AVAILABLE ON THE ISLAND INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS ARE MINOR IT HAS AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON AIR QUALITY AS IT REDUCES EMISSIONS BY HALF AND THE OVERALL COSTS OF THE PROGRAM IS SIMILAR TO GALVESTON ISLAND TRANSIT CURRENT COSTS OF OPERATING A DIESEL FLEET.,NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,C,CITY OR TOWNSHIP GOVERNMENT,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_TX-2022-036_6955/,2022-07-25 12:13:47.995222+00

IMPROVED ACCURACY OF REAL TIME ENGINE TORQUE MAY RESULT IN A MORE APPROPRIATE GEAR SELECTION IN TRANSMISSIONS THEREBY DELIVERING REDUCED FUEL CONSUMPTION AND BETTER KNOWLEDGE ABOUT POWERTRAIN OPERATION. AS EXHAUST TEMPERATURE AND EMISSION LEVELS DEPEND ON BOTH INSTANTANEOUS AND HISTORICAL ENGINE SPEED/TORQUE DEMANDS, IMPROVED ACCURACY IN REAL TIME TORQUE MEASUREMENT HELPS TO ADDRESS A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF HARMFUL EMISSIONS. THE PROPOSED DEVICE IS BEING DESIGNED FOR HEAVY AND MEDIUM TRUCK ENGINES FITTED IN TRANSPORTATION TRUCKS, OFF-HIGHWAY VEHICLES, MILITARY TRUCKS, AND OTHER VEHICLES IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. THIS PROJECT ALSO SEEKS TO EXTEND THE APPLICATION OF THIS TECHNIQUE TO COMPRESSED AND LIQUIFIED- NATURAL GAS-FUELED AND HYBRID VEHICLES. IMPROVED ACCURACY IN REAL TIME TORQUE MEASUREMENT WILL ENABLE ENGINEERS TO DEVELOP MORE ROBUST ANALYTICAL MODELS AND METHODS THAT WILL HELP REDUCE TRANSMISSION CALIBRATION TIME, WHILE PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENGINE PROGNOSTICS BY IDENTIFYING UNUSUAL VARIATIONS IN ENGINE PARAMETERS. THE PROPOSED PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP VTS TECHNOLOGY PROVIDING REAL-TIME ANALYSES OF ENGINE TORQUE TO FACILITATE OPTIMAL GEAR SHIFTING AND PROVIDE ENGINE PROGNOSTICS FOR VEHICLES. THE THREE MAJOR OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROJECT ARE: 1) BUILD A MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT WITH TESTED AND PROVEN FEATURES FOR DIFFERENT ENGINES, 2) PERFORM REAL-WORLD, ON-ROAD FUEL EFFICIENCY TRUCK TESTING USING VTS ENABLED IMPROVEMENTS, AND 3) DEVELOP A COMMERCIALIZATION PATH FOR MARKETING AND OBTAINING SENSOR CERTIFICATIONS. HISTORICALLY, THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY HAS STRUGGLED TO OBTAIN AND UTILIZE INEXPENSIVE, ACCURATE, ONBOARD SENSORS FOR ENGINE CONTROL APPLICATIONS. BETTER COORDINATION BETWEEN A VEHICLE?S ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION MAY ENABLE SMOOTHER GEAR SHIFTS AND IMPROVED FUEL ECONOMY AND VEHICLE PERFORMANCE. A SIMPLE, ACCURATE, AND COST-EFFECTIVE TORQUE SENSOR MAY IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND RELIABILITY OF ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION CONTROL. THE VTS ACCURACY RELIES UPON THE ABILITY TO EXTRACT ACCURATE TORQUE VALUES FROM HARMONIC INFORMATION CONTAINED WITHIN THE ENGINE FLYWHEEL SPEED. IN THIS PROJECT, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WITH A MACHINE LEARNING CAPABILITY WILL BE UTILIZED FOR ACCURATE AND RELIABLE TORQUE ANALYSIS. HOWEVER, THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO EXPAND UTILIZATION OF INSTANTANEOUS TORQUE MEASUREMENT METHODS TO BETTER ASSIST ENGINEERS IN DEVELOPING ADVANCED CONTROL METHODS FOR THE RAPIDLY DEVELOPING VEHICLE MOBILITY NETWORK.

SUPPORT FROM THE CERAMICS PROGRAM IN THE DIVISION OF MATERIALS RESEARCH ENABLES SUPPORTING UP TO FIVE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE EITHER GRADUATE STUDENTS, POST-DOCTORAL FELLOWS, OR EARLY CAREER INDIVIDUALS. PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS FROM GROUPS THAT ARE HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED IN THE STEM DISCIPLINES IS ACHIEVED THROUGH THIS TRAVEL PARTICIPANT/REGISTRATION AWARD. TECHNICAL ABSTRACT ULTRA-HIGH TEMPERATURE CERAMICS (UHTCS) - WHICH INCLUDES TRANSITION METAL CARBIDES, NITRIDES, AND BORIDES - ARE A FAMILY OF COMPOUNDS THAT DISPLAY A UNIQUE SET OF PROPERTIES, INCLUDING EXTREMELY HIGH MELTING TEMPERATURES (>3000 DEG. C), HIGH HARDNESS AND GOOD CHEMICAL STABILITY AND STRENGTH AT HIGH TEMPERATURES. THE COMBINATION OF PROPERTIES MAKES THESE MATERIALS CANDIDATES FOR A VARIETY OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE STRUCTURAL APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING ENGINES, HIGH-SPEED VEHICLES, PLASMA ARC ELECTRODES, CUTTING TOOLS, AND ADVANCED NUCLEAR FUEL USAGES. THE CONFERENCE?S FOCUS ON THE SCIENTIFIC STATUS OF UHTC AND THE ABILITY FOR LEADING EXPERTS TO SHARE THEIR DEVELOPMENTS WILL ENSURE A CONTINUATION OF NEW IDEAS AND NURTURE COLLABORATIONS THAT PROVIDE DISTINCT ADVANCEMENTS IN A CLASS THAT ARE EVER MORE RELEVANT TO MEET THE DEMANDS PLACED ON MATERIALS IN EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS. THE TRAVEL AWARD IS USED TO ENABLE GRADUATE, POST DOCS, AND/OR EARLY PROFESSIONALS, PARTICULARLY THOSE FROM UNDERREPRESENTED DEMOGRAPHICS IN STEM, TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CONFERENCE.

AIRCRAFT ARE EQUIPPED WITH PRIMARY FLIGHT INSTRUMENTATION FOR CONTROL  PERFORMANCE  NAVIGATION  AND SYSTEM SUPPORT. CONSIDERABLE ADVANCES HAVE BEEN MADE IN INTEGRATED ELECTRONIC FLIGHT INFORMATION SYSTEMS (EFIS) TO PROVIDE FLIGHT CREWS WITH INFORMATION FOR CONTROL OF AIRCRAFT ATTITUDE AND ENERGY STATE THROUGHOUT ALL PHASES OF FLIGHT. THE SAFETY RECORD OF PART 121 AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS IS EXCELLENT  MAKING COMMERCIAL AIR TRANSPORT THE SAFEST MODE OF TRANSPORTATION. IN ADDITION TO RIGOROUSLY DESIGNED AVIONICS AND RELIABLE AIRCRAFT PROPULSION AND CONTROLSYSTEMS (PART 25 FAR)  PART 121 OPERATIONS ARE PERFORMED BY TWO-PILOT CREWS TRAINED TO VERY HIGH STANDARDS. HOWEVER  RECENT ACCIDENT DATA [1] INDICATES A TREND IN THE WRONG DIRECTION  PARTICULARLY AMONG INTERNATIONAL OPERATORS. A NUMBER OF RECENT ACCIDENTS HAVE OCCURRED WITH HIGHLY AUTOMATED MODERN AIRCRAFT WHERE FLIGHT CREWS EXPERIENCED A LOSS OF ATTITUDE STATE AWARENESS (LASA) AND/OR A LOSS OF ENERGY STATE AWARENESS (LESA). THE RECENT AIR FRANCE 447 ACCIDENT (5/31/2009) IS A STARK EXAMPLE OF AN ACCIDENT DUE TO LESA DESPITE ENVELOPE PROTECTION AND A WELL-TRAINED CREW. WHILE THE MAJORITY OF THESE ACCIDENTS HAVE OCCURRED UNDER THE WATCH OF FOREIGN OPERATORS  THE TREND DATA CAN SERVE AS A WARNING TO US OPERATORS AND REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS SHOULD BE DESIGNED  PARTICULARLY WITH THE UPCOMING TRANSITION TO NEW OPERATING CONCEPTS SUCH AS NEXGEN THAT WILL INCREASE THE DEGREE OF AUTOMATION SUPPORT ON THE FLIGHT DECK WITH AN EVER-INCREASING OPERATIONAL TEMPO AND TRAFFIC DENSITIES. WE HAVE ASSEMBLED AN EXCELLENT TEAM TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES THROUGH RIGOROUS ENGINEERING ANALYSIS  VISUAL AND AUDITORY DISPLAY COUNTERMEASURES DESIGN  AND TESTING OFTHOSE DESIGNS IN A FLIGHT SIMULATOR AND FLIGHT TEST AIRCRAFT. OUR TEAM COMPRISES EXPERTS FROM BOEING  AN AIRFRAME MANUFACTURER  ROCKWELL COLLINS  AN AVIONICS MANUFACTURER  AND THE OPERATOR PERFORMANCE LABORATORY (OPL)  AN ACADEMIC FLIGHT SIMULATION AND FLIGHT TEST ORGANIZATION. OUR TEAM HAS A TRACK RECORD OF RESEARCH IN THE AREAS OF LASA/LESA ACCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS  COUNTERMEASURES DESIGN AND EVALUATION  NEXTGEN CENTRIC AVIONICS DESIGN  AND SYNTHETIC/ENHANCED VISION RESEARCH IN SIMULATION AND FLIGHT TEST. THE PROJECT IS PROGRAMMED AS A THREE-YEAR EFFORT WITH YEAR 1 FOCUSING ON ANALYSIS  YEAR 2 ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF FLIGHT-DECK INTERVENTIONS AND YEAR 3 ON SIMULATION AND FLIGHT TEST EVALUATION. YEAR 1 RESEARCH INVOLVES A DETAILED REASSESSMENT OF THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS OF LASA/LESA  A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF PAST BASELINE ACCIDENTS AND FUTURE RISK FACTORS WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON NEXGEN OPERATIONS AND JOINT CREW-AUTOMATION FAILURE MODES. YEAR 2 ACTIVITIES INCLUDE A COGNITIVE TASK ANALYSIS (CTA) WITH EMPHASIS ON NEXGEN OPERATIONS  THE DEVELOPMENT AND DOWN-SELECTION OF FLIGHT-DECK INTERVENTIONS  AND AN ANALYSIS OF MOTION ENVELOPE TECHNIQUES FOR LASA/LESA RESEARCH IN TYPICAL LEVEL D FLIGHT SIMULATION FACILITIES. YEAR 3 INVOLVES TWO TEST SPIRALS ON THE NASA RESEARCH FLIGHT DECK (RFD)SIMULATOR  INTERLEAVED WITH TWO TEST SPIRALS ON THE INSTRUMENTED OPL L-29 FLIGHT TEST AIRCRAFT FOLLOWED BY ONE ADDITIONAL VALIDATION SPIRAL ON THE L-29 AT THE END OF YEAR 3.

EARLY-STAGE DETECTION OF CANCERS (MOST OFTEN ORAL SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA (OSCC)) WOULD ENABLE LESS DISFIGURING, LESS COSTLY THERAPY WITH CURATIVE INTENT. HOWEVER, LIMITATIONS OF TRADITIONAL VISUAL-TACTILE EXAMINATION FOR ORAL CANCEROUS AND PRE- CANCEROUS LESIONS HAVE HINDERED CANCER DETECTION AND SUPPORT FOR SCREENING. VISUAL INSPECTION FOR SEPARATION OF BENIGN FROM PRECANCEROUS OR CANCEROUS LESIONS IS INACCURATE, AND THEREFORE STANDARD PRACTICE ENTAILS REFERRAL AND SCALPEL BIOPSY OF MOST POTENTIALLY MALIGNANT ORAL LESIONS. FURTHERMORE, APPROXIMATELY 20% OF POTENTIALLY MALIGNANT ORAL LESIONS CONTAIN SOME DEGREE OF EPITHELIAL DYSPLASIA OR CARCINOMA, AND THEREFORE EARLY IDENTIFICATION COULD ALLOW CURATIVE TREATMENT AS THE MAJORITY OF OSCC TYPICALLY STARTS AS DYSPLASIA, AND THE DEGREE OF DYSPLASIA IS CORRELATED WITH THE RATE OF MALIGNANT TRANSFORMATION. DETRACTORS OF ORAL SCREENING CITE THE HIGH PREVALENCE OF BENIGN ORAL LESIONS AND MILD DYSPLASIA AS CIRCUMSTANCES PLACING PATIENTS AT RISK OF HARMS FROM OVER-TESTING AND OVER-TREATMENT. THUS, SCREENING EFFORTS COULD BE TRANSFORMED BY ADJUNCTIVE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS THAT OFFER HIGHLY ACCURATE CYTOPATHOLOGIC INFORMATION AT THE POINT OF CARE, SUCH AS THE NIDCR-SUPPORTED POINT-OF-CARE ORAL CYTOPATHOLOGY TOOL. COMPUTER VISION-ASSISTED PRECISION IMAGING TESTS HAVE RECENTLY SHOWN STRONG DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE FOR ORAL LESION CHARACTERIZATION, BUT THEIR POTENTIAL PITFALLS AND PROMISES MUST BE THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED BEFORE CLINICAL APPLICATION. SIMILARLY, MACHINE LEARNING COULD BOLSTER OPTICAL TESTS FOR VISUALIZING POTENTIALLY MALIGNANT LESIONS. IF SUCCESSFUL, THESE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DEVICES COULD AID DECISION- MAKING, PREVENTING UNNECESSARY SCALPEL BIOPSIES FOR LOW-RISK LESIONS AND ENABLING RISK-STRATIFIED SURVEILLANCE OR TREATMENT. OUR TEAM OF EXPERTS IN COMPUTER DISEASE SIMULATION MODELING, MACHINE LEARNING, ORAL MEDICINE, AND ECONOMIC EVALUATION WILL TRANSFORM A DISEASE SIMULATION MODEL TO PROVIDE ANALYSIS AT THE POINT OF CARE, AND EVALUATE THE DIFFERENT POTENTIAL USES OF PRECISION IMAGING DIAGNOSTICS FOR TRANSLATION TO CLINICAL CARE. WE WILL EXPAND OUR EXISTING DISEASE MODEL OF POTENTIALLY MALIGNANT ORAL LESIONS TO REPRESENT LESION CHARACTERISTICS AND CLINICAL RISK CATEGORIES (E.G. BASED ON TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL USE) THROUGH INCORPORATION OF LARGE LONGITUDINAL DATASETS (AIM 1), IN ORDER TO EVALUATE WHETHER ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-ASSISTED CYTOLOGIC TESTING CAN IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF SCREENING FOR LOW, MODERATE, OR HIGH RISK CATEGORIES (AIM 2). FINALLY, WE WILL EVALUATE WHETHER ADJUNCTS FOR LESION VISUALIZATION RENDER FAVORABLE EFFECTIVENESS AND COST EFFECTIVENESS OF SCREENING ACROSS RISK CATEGORIES, WITH OR WITHOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SUPPORT, AND DEVELOP A USER INTERFACE FOR THE MODEL (AIM 3).

ITS WORLDWIDE PRODUCTION, AMOUNTING TO 4.5 BILLION TONS PER YEAR, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ~8% OF ANTHROPOGENIC CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS AND ~25% OF ALL INDUSTRY CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS. CEMENT MANUFACTURING IS AMONG THE HARDEST INDUSTRIES TO DECARBONIZE BECAUSE THE CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS ARE UNAVOIDABLE RESULTS OF ESSENTIAL CHEMICAL REACTIONS (E.G., DECARBONATION OF LIMESTONE TO PRODUCE LIME AND CARBON DIOXIDE) AND HIGH-TEMPERATURE PROCESSES POWERED BY CARBON DIOXIDE -INTENSIVE COMBUSTION OF FOSSIL FUELS. AS THE U.S. EMBARKS ON A ONCE-IN-A-CENTURY INFRASTRUCTURE REVIVAL PROGRAM, WHILE ALSO COMMITTING TO SLASH CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS BY >50% BY 2030 (TO LIMIT GLOBAL WARMING TO 1.5 DEGREE CELSIUS, AS PER THE PARIS AGREEMENT), THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO DISRUPTIVELY TRANSFORM CEMENT MANUFACTURING, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT THE PRODUCTION-AND-USE OF PORTLAND CEMENT IS POISED TO GROW TO >6 GT BY 2030. THIS PROJECT REIMAGINES CEMENT PRODUCTION THROUGH END-TO-END TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGHS THAT FEATURES A SOLAR ENERGY-POWERED, TWO-STAGE PROCESS: A NOVEL ELECTROCHEMICAL DECARBONATION PROCESS TO PRODUCE LIME WITHOUT ATTENDANT CARBON DIOXIDE RELEASE; AND ULTRAFAST PRODUCTION OF CEMENT VIA A NOVEL HIGH TEMPERATURE SYNTHESIS PROCEDURE. THE TWO-STAGE PROCESS ENABLES UNPRECEDENTED MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES; WITH COST-, ENERGY-, AND CARBON DIOXIDE -EFFICIENCIES SUBSTANTIALLY BETTER THAN THOSE OF CONTEMPORARY MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES.

THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO ENABLE THE PRODUCTION OF PORTLAND CEMENT, AS WELL AS OTHER LIME-BASED CEMENTS, IN A CARBON -NEUTRAL AND ENERGY-EFFICIENT MANNER. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, THE PROJECT ADVANCES SEVERAL TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS: (1) LOW-TEMPERATURE, CARBON-NEUTRAL DECOMPOSITION OF LIMESTONE INTO LIME; (2) ULTRAFAST PRODUCTION OF CEMENTS, THAT ARE PHYSICALLY AND CHEMICALLY SIMILAR TO THEIR COMMERCIAL COUNTERPARTS, VIA A HIGH TEMPERATURE SYNTHESIS PROCEDURE; (3) USE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY, IN LIEU OF FOSSIL FUELS, TO POWER ALL SUB-PROCESSES OF CEMENT MANUFACTURING; AND (4) SYNERGISTIC USE OF ADVANCED EXPERIMENTS, THERMODYNAMIC AND MULTIPHYSICS SIMULATIONS, AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO OPTIMIZE THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, THAT RESULTS IN A FAMILY OF SUSTAINABLE, NEXT-GENERATION CEMENTS. OUTCOMES OF THIS WORK ARE EXPECTED TO SUBSTANTIALLY ADVANCE UNDERSTANDING OF PROCESS PARAMETERS THAT INFLUENCE THE KINETICS, EFFICIENCY, AND QUALITY OF THE PRODUCTS FROM BOTH STAGES OF THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. A SIMPLE, EASY-TO-USE SOFTWARE, WITH HARDWIRED THERMODYNAMICS AND MACHINE LEARNING ENGINES, WILL BE DEVELOPED TO AID MANUFACTURERS IN ASCERTAINING OPTIMAL RECIPES BASED ON THEIR CEMENT PRODUCTION TARGETS.

AS THE U.S. ELDERLY POPULATION CONTINUES TO INCREASE, AD INCIDENCE RISES AS WELL, AS THERE IS NO NEUROPROTECTIVE THERAPY OR CURE. COMMON SYMPTOMS INCLUDE MEMORY LOSS, COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, DISORIENTATION, AND PSYCHIATRIC ISSUES. TRADITIONALLY, DIAGNOSIS IS ACHIEVED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF CLINICAL CRITERIA SUCH AS NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION, MENTAL STATUS TESTS & BRAIN IMAGING. HOWEVER, THESE STRATEGIES ARE CHALLENGING FOR DETECTION OF EARLY AD OR PATIENTS WITH MILD SYMPTOMS, SPECIFICALLY DURING THE MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT (MCI) STAGE. MENTAL STATUS TESTS & SUBJECTIVE JOURNALS, KEPT BY PATIENTS OR CAREGIVERS, CAN TRACK AD PROGRESSION, BUT HAVE LOW SENSITIVITY AND RELIABILITY.

THIS DELIBERATION PROCESS IS CENTRAL TO BEHAVIORAL AND COGNITIVE FLEXIBILITY BUT REQUIRES OVERCOMING A MAJOR CHALLENGE: DETERMINING WHEN TO STOP DELIBERATING AND COMMIT TO A COURSE OF ACTION. MANY MODELS THAT HAVE BEEN USED TO STUDY HUMAN DECISION-MAKING AND TO IMPLEMENT MACHINE DECISION-MAKING ASSUME THAT DECISION COMMITMENT OCCURS WHEN THE ACCUMULATED EVIDENCE REACHES A FIXED VALUE OR BOUND. THESE ?ACCUMULATE-TO-BOUND? MODELS, WHOSE DEVELOPMENT LAST CENTURY HELPED FORMALIZE AND IMPROVE DECISIONS RELATED TO CODEBREAKING, MANUFACTURING, AND OTHER REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS, HAVE ALSO PROVIDED A USEFUL STARTING POINT FOR UNDERSTANDING DECISION COMMITMENT IN THE BRAIN. HOWEVER, FIXED BOUNDS ARE MOST APPROPRIATE UNDER FIXED CONDITIONS, WHICH ARE OFTEN USED IN LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS BUT RARELY ENCOUNTERED IN THE REAL WORLD. THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO MOVE BEYOND THE ?FIXED BOUND? FORM OF DECISION COMMITMENT AND INSTEAD CONSIDER MORE FLEXIBLE WAYS THE BRAIN USES TO END DELIBERATING AND ARRIVE AT A DECISION. THE RESEARCH STARTS WITH A NEW, MATHEMATICALLY GROUNDED THEORY THAT DESCRIBES THE ADVANTAGES OF USING FLEXIBLE FORMS OF COMMITMENT UNDER CHANGING CONDITIONS. THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS (PIS) THEN USE THIS THEORY TO DESIGN AND INTERPRET EXPERIMENTS THAT WILL PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE NEW VIEW OF HOW HUMAN BRAINS COMMIT TO DECISIONS EVEN WHEN THEY ARE BASED ON DELIBERATIONS THAT OCCUR DURING UNCERTAIN AND CHANGING CONDITIONS. THIS WORK WILL PROVIDE INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING AT THE INTERFACE OF MATHEMATICS, COGNITIVE SCIENCE, PSYCHOLOGY, AND NEUROSCIENCE FOR UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS. THE PIS WILL USE RESEARCH-RELATED ACTIVITIES TO ENCOURAGE THE PARTICIPATION OF UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS IN SCIENCE. ALSO, THE PIS WILL DEVELOP AND DISSEMINATE RESOURCES, INCLUDING NOVEL DATASETS AND ANALYTIC TOOLS, THAT WILL BENEFIT RESEARCH AND EDUCATION IN HOW THE BRAIN MAKES DECISIONS. FINALLY, THE PIS WILL INCREASE PUBLIC AWARENESS OF COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE AND ADDRESS THE URGENT NEED TO INCREASE SCIENTIFIC LITERACY AND UNDERSTANDING OF HOW SCIENCE CAN BENEFIT SOCIETY. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED VIA PUBLIC LECTURES, CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PROGRAM ?ENGINES OF OUR INGENUITY? BROADCAST BY NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO STATIONS NATIONWIDE, BRAIN AWARENESS WEEK ACTIVITIES, AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO A WEBSITE THAT EXPLAINS BRAIN RESEARCH TO NON-SPECIALISTS. DELIBERATIVE DECISIONS FREE THE BRAIN FROM THE IMMEDIACY OF REFLEXIVE PROCESSING BUT POSE A CRITICAL CHALLENGE: HOW DOES THE BRAIN DECIDE WHEN TO STOP DELIBERATING AND COMMIT TO A COURSE OF ACTION? OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS COMMITMENT PROCESS HAS BEEN DOMINATED BY A COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORK THAT ASSUMES DECISIONS ARE TERMINATED ONCE ACCUMULATED EVIDENCE REACHES A PREDEFINED LEVEL OR BOUND. THESE ?ACCUMULATE-TO-BOUND? MODELS HAVE CLOSE TIES TO NORMATIVE THEORY AND CAN EXPLAIN A RANGE OF BEHAVIORAL AND NEURAL FINDINGS. HOWEVER, THEY ARE OPTIMAL ONLY UNDER THE HIGHLY RESTRICTIVE CONDITIONS USED IN MANY DECISION STUDIES, IN WHICH THE INFORMATIVENESS, RATE OF ACQUISITION, AND OTHER FEATURES OF THE EVIDENCE ARE STABLE AND KNOWN IN ADVANCE. IT IS NOT KNOWN HOW THE BRAIN BALANCES DECISION DELIBERATION AND COMMITMENT MORE GENERALLY, WHEN TEMPORALLY EXTENDED DECISIONS MUST CONTEND WITH OUR DYNAMIC AND UNCERTAIN WORLD. THE GOAL IS TO ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE DECISION RULES USED BY THE BRAIN UNDER THESE CONDITIONS. THE PIS START WITH A NOVEL THEORETICAL FOUNDATION THAT INCLUDES FLEXIBLE DECISION BOUNDS THAT ARE NOT PREDEFINED BUT INSTEAD CAN BE UPDATED WHILE THE DECISION IS BEING FORMED TO OPTIMIZE PERFORMANCE EVEN UNDER CHANGING CONDITIONS. THEY USE THIS FRAMEWORK TO GUIDE THE DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF BEHAVIORAL STUDIES IN HUMANS AND COMBINE BEHAVIORAL AND NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL STUDIES IN NON-HUMAN PRIMATES, WHICH THEY USE TO TEST THEIR PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS THAT THE PRIMATE BRAIN USES DYNAMIC, ADAPTIVE RULES TO SUPPORT RATIONAL DECISION-MAKING IN CHANGING AND UNCERTAIN ENVIRONMENTS.

THIS RESULTS IN SUB- OPTIMAL DECISION MAKING, INCOMPLETE PRE-AUTHORIZATION (PRE-AUTH) DOCUMENTATION, AND PROBLEMS WITH REIMBURSEMENT. OVERALL, THIS INCREASES MEDICAL COSTS AND PAYMENT DEFICITS WITHIN ONCOLOGY. FOR EXAMPLE, PRE- AUTH INEFFICIENCIES ARE ESTIMATED TO ADD $83,000 A YEAR PER PHYSICIAN TO HEALTHCARE COSTS, WHICH IS $1.1 BILLION ANNUALLY IN ONCOLOGY ALONE. TO DEVISE A TREATMENT PLAN, ONCOLOGISTS REFERENCE NATIONAL COMPREHENSIVE CANCER NETWORK GUIDELINES® (NCCN), OTHER CLINICAL SOCIETY STANDARDS, AND PAYOR SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS IN THE CONTEXT OF A PATIENT’S MEDICAL HISTORY, TUMOR CHARACTERISTICS, AND PHASE OF TREATMENT. ONE OF THE MOST USED ONCOLOGY TREATMENT GUIDELINES REFERENCED BY ONCOLOGISTS AND ADHERED TO BY MOST PAYORS IS THE NATIONAL COMPREHENSIVE CANCER NETWORK (NCCN) GUIDELINES®. THESE GUIDELINES ARE PRESENTED AS A SCHEMA THAT SPAN 100S OF PAGES.  A TECHNOLOGY DRIVEN CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT (CDS) SYSTEM COULD BE EMPLOYED TO ADDRESS THE NEED TO STREAMLINE TREATMENT GUIDELINE ANALYSIS, PAYOR RULES REVIEW, AND TREATMENT DECISION DOCUMENTATION FOR REDUCED OVERALL COST TO ONCOLOGY PRACTICES. THIS PROPOSAL FOCUSES ON DEVELOPING AN INNOVATIVE AND FIRST-OF- A-KIND TECHNOLOGY FOR CDS USING NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER (NSCLC) AS THE INITIAL TEST CASE AND INCORPORATING NCCN GUIDELINES, GENERAL PAYOR SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS AND PATIENT DATA OVERLAID TO COMPUTE FEASIBLE TREATMENT PATHWAYS. THE TEAM PROPOSES THE FOLLOWING PHASE I SPECIFIC AIMS: AIM 1: DEVELOP A GRAPH-BASED MATHEMATICAL MODEL AND VISUAL PRESENTATION OF NSCLC NCCN TREATMENT GUIDELINES WITH GENERALIZED PAYOR SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS. DEVELOP A VISUALLY INTERACTIVE GRAPH-BASED REPRESENTATION OF NCCN GUIDELINES®. MODELING GUIDELINES AS A VISUAL GRAPH (NODES AND ARCS) WILL ENABLE ONCOLOGISTS TO IDENTIFY THE OPTIMAL TREATMENT PATHWAY FOR THEIR PATIENTS. AIM 2: BUILD AN ANALYTICS ENGINE THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE NCCN GRAPH MODEL WITH FEASIBLE TREATMENT OPTIONS GIVEN THE PATIENT’S CASE DETAILS AND COMMON PAYOR REQUIREMENTS. USE AN OPENSOURCE TOOL TO CREATE SYNTHETIC PATIENT DATA AND COMMON PAYOR CONSTRAINTS WITH AN ONCOLOGIST AND HEALTH PLAN EXPERTS. DEVELOP A LIBRARY OF GRAPH TRAVERSAL ALGORITHMS TO OVERLAY AND VISUALIZE THE PATIENT DATA IN A VISUAL USER INTERFACE. AIM 3: EXECUTE, VALIDATE AND TEST A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT CDS WORKFLOW USING ONCOPATH. RUN THE COMPLETE END-TO-END CDS WORKFLOW WITH DOCUMENTATION OF PATIENT DETAILS, NCCN GUIDELINE, PAYOR REQUIREMENTS AND TREATMENT DECISION USING SYNTHETIC PATIENT DATA AND PAYOR CONSTRAINTS GENERATED IN AIM 2.  ONCOPATH WILL ENABLE AN EFFICIENT, ONCOLOGIST-FRIENDLY APPROACH TO TREATMENT DECISIONS AND DOCUMENTATION, SUBSEQUENTLY BENEFITTING THE PATIENT AND DECREASING ONCOLOGY COST.

THE HEALTH COMMUNITY HAS RESPONDED TO THIS TREND WITH RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY LEVERAGING DATA THAT GOES BEYOND WHAT IS CUSTOMARILY THOUGHT OF AS “HEALTH DATA”, SUCH AS COMMU- NITY AND CONTEXTUAL DATA, SOCIAL MEDIA, TRAFFIC, AND MOBILITY DATA. FOR EXAMPLE, NSOESIE ET AL.[84] ANALYZED HOSPITAL TRAFFIC AND SEARCH ENGINE DATA IN WUHAN TO INFER EARLY DISEASE ACTIVITY IN FALL 2019. THESE NEW EFFORTS, INCLUDING OUR OWN WORK IN UTILIZING MOBILITY DATA TO FORECAST COVID- 19’S TRANSMISSION RISK [94], USES WHAT THIS NSF CALL-FOR-PROPOSAL REFERS TO AS “NON-TRADITIONAL HEALTH DATA”. IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE FOCUS ON ONE SPECIFIC TYPE OF NON-TRADITIONAL HEALTH DATA, WEARABLE DATA, WHICH ARE ALSO FAST BECOMING AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF HEALTH AND DISEASE DATA AS THEY INFORM ON A VARIETY OF PERSONAL, BEHAVIORAL, SOCIAL, CONTEXTUAL, AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH-RELEVANT FACTORS. WEARABLES HAVE BEEN PRIMARILY USED FOR ACTIVITY TRACKING [96, 15, 20, 80] AND GAINED POPULARITY WITH FITNESS APPLICATIONS; HOWEVER, MORE RECENTLY, THESE DEVICES HAVE BEEN USED IN AN INCREASING NUMBER OF HEALTH APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING HEALTH MONITORING, CLINICAL-CARE, REMOTE CLINICAL-TRIALS, DRUG DELIVERY, AND DISEASE CHARACTERIZATION TO NAME A FEW. IN FACT, WEARABLES HAVE BEEN FOUND USEFUL IN A NUM- BER OF APPLICATIONS AND DISEASES (E.G., PARKINSON’S DISEASE, EPILEPSY AND STROKE [57], SLEEP DISOR- DERS [12], CARDIAC DISORDERS [90, 63] AND CANCER [75]). THIS TREND IS ACCELERATING WITH THE COVID-19 EPIDEMIC, E.G., SMARTPHONES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO TRACK SYMPTOMS [64], MONITOR EFFECTIVENESS OF NON-PHARMACEUTICAL INTERVENTIONS, ASSESS POTENTIAL SPREAD, AND SUPPORT CONTACT TRACING [45]. WEARABLE MEASUREMENTS DIFFER FROM TRADITIONAL CLINICAL MEASUREMENTS. WHEN A PATIENT VISITS A CLINIC, VITALS AND LAB TESTS ARE COLLECTED IN A “CONTROLLED” ENVIRONMENT IN A SHORT DURATION OF TIME USING MULTIPLE DEVICES. WE DEFINE THIS MONITORING IN THE CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT AS SNAPSHOT IN-CLINIC MONITORING, ABBREVIATED AS SIC. MEANWHILE, THE RECENT GROWTH AND ACCESSIBILITY OF THE WEARABLE DEVICES SUCH AS SMARTPHONES AND WATCHES [97] WITH EMBEDDED ACTIVITY AND MOBILE SENSORS [114] ENABLES THE CONTINUOUS MONITORING OF PATIENTS’ VITAL SIGNS AND OTHER HEALTH INDICATORS OVER A LONG DURATION OF TIME. PATIENT MONITORING USING WEARABLE DEVICES TYPICALLY HAPPENS IN AN “UNCONTROLLED” SETUP AT HOME OR AT WORK IN A NON-INTRUSIVE FASHION WITH ONLY A FEW SENSORS. THIS TREND HAS ALSO BEEN ENCAPSULATED BY THE NIH MHEALTH’S INITIATIVES, RESULTING IN THE EVOLUTION OF NEW HEALTHCARE MODELS SUCH AS “HOME HEALTHCARE” [9, 40] AND “MINUTE CLINIC” [125], WHICH GOES HAND IN HAND WITH BOTH UBIQUITOUS SENSORS IN SMARTPHONES AND CUSTOM SENSORS LIKE GLUCOSE MONITORS [62]. WE DEFINE THIS MONITORING IN THE UNCONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT AS LONGITUDINAL IN-FIELD MONITORING, ABBREVIATED AS LIFE. CLEARLY THESE ARE WORDPLAY, I.E., SIC IS FOR “SICK” CAPTURING PATIENTS’ STATE OF MIND WHEN THEY VISIT A CLINIC/HOSPITAL VS. LIFE FOR WHEN PATIENTS LIVE THEIR NORMAL “LIFE” AT HOME AND AT WORK. LIFE MONITORING MAKES UP FOR GREATER THAN 99% OF PATIENTS’ TIME, ENABLING OUTPATIENT MONITORING OF THE EFFECTS OF DISEASE AND ITS THERAPY ON PATIENT PERFORMANCE AND QUALITY OF LIFE. IN FACT, OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SHOW THAT IN SOME CASES, SUCH AS ASSESSMENT OF PERFORMANCE STATUS IN CANCER PATIENTS, LIFE DATA OUTPERFORM IN-OFFICE SIC ASSESSMENTS [82].

MOST CLINICAL OCT SYSTEMS ARE LARGE TABLETOP DEVICES THAT REQUIRE A COMPLIANT SUBJECT, AND THUS ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR USE WITH INFANTS, YOUNG CHILDREN, AND PATIENTS WHO ARE UNABLE TO COOPERATE FOR EYE IMAGING (SUCH AS FROM PHYSICAL DISABILITY OR DURING EYE EXAMINATION UNDER ANESTHESIA). AS MANY OF THESE PATIENTS CANNOT COMMUNICATE ABOUT VISION DISTURBANCE OR VISION LOSS, DIAGNOSIS OF DISEASE IN THESE PATIENTS IS DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE BEFORE IRREVOCABLE VISION LOSS OCCURS. ONE EXAMPLE IS PRETERM INFANTS AT RISK FOR RETINOPATHY OF PREMATURITY (ROP) WHO MAKE UP 1.4% OF THE NEWBORN POPULATION. WHILE HANDHELD OCT (HH-OCT) HAS LED TO SIGNIFICANT INSIGHTS INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ROP, THE USE OF HH-OCT FOR DISEASE SCREENING HAS BEEN LIMITED DUE TO THE POOR USABILITY OF EXISTING COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS. CAPTURING IMAGES IN AWAKE INFANTS WITH THESE SYSTEMS IS CHALLENGING, REQUIRING SPECIALIZED RESEARCH STAFF WITH SIGNIFICANT TRAINING. THERE IS A NEED FOR A POINT OF CARE, HIGH-SPEED, USER-FRIENDLY HANDHELD OCT SYSTEM TO IMPROVE THE STANDARD OF CARE OF INFANTS, YOUNG CHILDREN, AND PATIENTS WHO ARE UNABLE TO COOPERATE FOR IMAGING.  THEIA IMAGING IS LED BY A TEAM OF EXPERTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT HH-OCT SYSTEMS.

THIS WILL DECREASE THE NEED FOR EXAMINATIONS UNDER ANESTHESIA AND SIMPLIFY ACCESS TO VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE RETINA AND OPTIC NERVE HEAD AT THE TIME OF EYE CARE AND GENERAL HEALTH CARE.  THROUGH THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS, WE WILL BEGIN THE PROCESS OF TRANSLATING SUCH AN HH-OCT SYSTEM, WITH IMPROVED SPEED, ERGONOMICS, AND USABILITY AS COMPARED TO COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE SYSTEMS. SPECIFIC AIM 1: DEVELOP A PORTABLE, HIGH-SPEED OCT SYSTEM WITH ERGONOMIC, USER-FRIENDLY HANDHELD PROBE. WE WILL DEVELOP A 300 KHZ OCT SYSTEM (THE FASTEST MEDICAL OCT SYSTEM OF ANY KIND) WITH A LIGHTWEIGHT, ERGONOMIC HANDHELD PROBE. SPECIFIC AIM 2: DEVELOP REAL-TIME, WORKFLOW-OPTIMIZED OCT CAPTURE SOFTWARE. WE WILL DEVELOP REAL TIME, OCT ACQUISITION SOFTWARE FOR THE 300 KHZ OCT SYSTEM ENGINE AND AN INTUITIVE WORKFLOW- OPTIMIZED USER INTERFACE/USER EXPERIENCE. SPECIFIC AIM 3: VALIDATION STUDY. USE OF THE PROPOSED HH-OCT SYSTEM WILL BE COMPARED TO CURRENT COMMERCIAL HH-OCT SYSTEMS IN A VALIDATION STUDY. THE EXPECTED OUTCOME OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THE DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF A PROTOTYPE HIGH-SPEED, USER-FRIENDLY HH-OCT SYSTEM AND SOFTWARE USABLE BY OPHTHALMIC AND OPTOMETRIC TECHNICIANS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR SPECIALIZED TRAINING.

AS A PART OF FULFILLING THIS OBJECTIVE  THE STRATEGIC PLAN AIMS TO SEND A HUMAN MISSION TO MARS IN THE 2030S. THE ADVANCEMENT OF IN-SPACE PROPULSION TECHNOLOGIES IS ESSENTIAL IN ORDER TO FULFILL THIS OBJECTIVE. NASAS MOST RECENT IN-SPACE PROPULSION SYSTEMS ROAD MAP (TABS 02) CITES THE NEED TO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGIES WHICH ENABLE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE EXPLORATION OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM. MORE EFFECTIVE IN-SPACE PROPULSION SYSTEMS MUST BE MISSION ENABLING AS WELL AS REDUCE TRANSIT TIMES  INCREASE PAYLOAD MASS  AND DECREASE COSTS. FOR A HUMAN MARS MISSION  THE INSPACE PROPULSION OF CHOICE SHOULD BE CAPABLE OF HIGH THRUST LEVELS AND HIGH SPECIFIC IMPULSE TO REDUCE TRANSIT TIME. A NON-CHEMICAL PROPULSION TECHNOLOGY  NUCLEAR THERMAL PROPULSION (NTP)  HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY TESTED IN THE UNITED STATES AND FORMER SOVIET UNION. A NTP ENGINE HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR TWICE THE SPECIFIC IMPULSE OF THE BEST CHEMICAL ENGINES (880 - 900 S) AND 25 - 500 KLBF THRUST (100 - 2 200 KN). THUS  THIS TECHNOLOGY IS EXPECTED TO REDUCE TRANSIT TIME AND LAUNCH MASS  THEREFORE REDUCING MISSION COSTS. THESE ATTRIBUTES ALLOW INCREASED MISSION FLEXIBILITY BY INCREASING AVAILABLE PAYLOAD MASS AND ENABLING LONGER STAYS ON MARS. BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE ADVANTAGES NUCLEAR THERMAL PROPULSION CAN OFFER  IN THE NATIONAL RESOURCE COUNCILS REVIEW OF NASAS INSPACE PROPULSION SYSTEMS ROADMAP  NUCLEAR THERMAL PROPULSION WAS RANKED AS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR IN-SPACE PROPULSION DEVELOPMENT. UNDER NSTRF15  THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO AID THE DEVELOPMENT OF NUCLEAR FUEL FORMS FOR USE IN A NUCLEAR THERMAL ROCKET (NTR). THIS WILL BE COMPLETED THROUGH THE IDENTIFICATION AND QUALIFICATION OF NUCLEAR FUEL FORM PROPERTY DATA USING NON-NUCLEAR TESTING. THIS DATA IS ESSENTIAL IN ORDER TO MODEL FUEL BEHAVIOR AND PREDICT FUEL PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS PREPARE NUCLEAR FUEL FORMS FOR EVENTUAL IRRADIATION TESTING. PREVIOUS NTP PROGRAMS (SUCH AS THE NERVA/ROVER PROGRAM) TOOK THE APPROACH OF TESTING NUCLEAR FUELS THROUGH NUCLEAR OPERATION OF A FULL SCALE REACTOR CORE. HOWEVER  THIS METHODOLOGY IS COSTLY AND SUBJECT TO STRINGENT SAFETY REQUIREMENTS. RECENT RESEARCH DEVELOPMENTS HAVE SHOWN THAT NTP FUEL FORMS CANNOT BE IDENTICALLY RE-CAPTURED FROM PAST NTP PROGRAMS BECAUSE OF THE LOSS OF MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES. THEREFORE  NEW MANUFACTURING PROCESSES MUST BE DEVELOPED TO MATURE FUEL FORMS TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE UNDER THE DESIRED CONDITIONS FOR THE NTR CORE AND NEW PROPERTY DATA MUST BE OBTAINED. LESSONS LEARNED FROM PAST NTP PROGRAMS HAVE SHOWN THAT CERTAIN THERMAL AND MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF PAST NTP FUEL FORMS DIRECTLY CORRELATE TO THE POTENTIAL FOR SUCCESSFUL NTR OPERATION AND HIGH TEMPERATURE PERFORMANCE. SINCE NEW MANUFACTURING METHODS ARE NEEDED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NTP FUEL FORMS  THE THERMAL AND MATERIAL PROPERTIES DATA ARCHIVED FROM PREVIOUS PROGRAMS IS NOT DIRECTLY APPLICABLE FOR FUEL PERFORMANCE SIMULATIONS AND THE ULTIMATE FUEL SELECTION PROCESS. THE PRIMARY RESEARCH OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO CHARACTERIZE A NTP FUEL FORM WHICH CAN WITHSTAND OPERATING CONDITIONS OF OVER 2800 K IN A HOT HYDROGEN ENVIRONMENT. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES WILL EVALUATE FUEL PERFORMANCE AT EXPECTED IN-CORE VIBRATION  PRESSURE  AND TEMPERATURE GRADIENTS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATION. IN ORDER TO MEET PROJECT OBJECTIVES  THE METHODS OF THIS PROJECT WILL CONSIST OF: 1) SELECTION OF OF FUEL FORM CHEMISTRY AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES  2) NON-NUCLEAR FUEL TESTING AND CHARACTERIZATION OF FUEL MATERIAL AND THERMAL PROPERTIES  AND 3) COMPUTATIONAL FUEL MODELING FOR EXPECTED OPERATING CONDITIONS.

THE PROPOSED RESEARCH COMPRISES NUMERICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL WORK TO BE CONDUCTED AT THE PLASMADYNAMICS AND ELECTRIC PROPULSION LABORATORY (PEPL) AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. THIS WORK WILL BUILD UPON RESEARCH PERFORMED BY GROUPS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN  PRINCETON UNIVERSITY  AD ASTRA  AND SEVERAL OTHER INSTITUTIONS. MAGNETIC NOZZLES PLAY A KEY ROLE IN SEVERAL IN-SPACE PROPULSION TECHNOLOGY CONCEPTS RANGING FROM GIGAWATT FUSION DEVICES TO CUBESAT MICRO-THRUSTERS. DESPITE THEIR VAST POTENTIAL  THE UNDERLYING PHYSICS OF THESE DEVICES IS NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD. SOME OF THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS RELEVANT TO MAGNETIC NOZZLE PHYSICS INCLUDE: 1) HOW ARE IONS ACCELERATED IN A DIVERGING MAGNETIC FIELD? 2) HOW IS MOMENTUM TRANSFERRED TO THE THRUSTER IN A MAGNETIC NOZZLE? 3) HOW DOES PLASMA DETACH FROM THE MAGNETIC FIELD LINES DOWNSTREAM OF THE THRUSTER? SEVERAL GROUPS HAVE STUDIED THESE EFFECTS OVER THE YEARS. HOWEVER  THESE QUESTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN DEFINITIVELY ANSWERED. THE FACILITIES  DIAGNOSTICS  AND PLASMA SOURCES AVAILABLE AT PEPL PROVIDE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNDERLYING PHYSICS OF MAGNETIC NOZZLES. FINAL EXPERIMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED IN PEPL S LARGE VACUUM TEST FACILITY  A 9 METER LONG  6 METER DIAMETER VACUUM CHAMBER CAPABLE OF EXTREMELY FAST PUMPING SPEEDS. THIS CHAMBER WILL ALLOW FOR MEASUREMENTS TO BE TAKEN VIRTUALLY FREE OF FACILITY EFFECTS WHICH ARE THEORIZED TO SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER MAGNETIC NOZZLE PERFORMANCE. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND INITIAL TESTS WILL BE CONDUCTED IN PEPL S NANOSATELLITE ENGINE OPERATION VACUUM CHAMBER  A 1.5 METER LONG  1 METER DIAMETER VACUUM CHAMBER WITH A VERY SHORT PUMP DOWN TIME. THE COMBINATION OF THESE TWO TESTING FACILITIES WILL ENABLE VERY ACCURATE FINAL RESULTS WITH A SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED DEVELOPMENT AND ITERATION TIME  AND WILL ALSO PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO FACILITY EFFECTS ON MAGNETIC NOZZLES. ELECTROSTATIC PROBES AND ADVANCED DIAGNOSTICS  SUCH AS RESONANT PROBES AND LASER INDUCED FLUORESCENCE  WILL BE UTILIZED TO STUDY THE PLUME OF THE MAGNETIC NOZZLE THRUSTER EXPERIMENT. NOVEL TECHNIQUES DESCRIBED IN RECENT RADIOFREQUENCY THRUSTER PROJECTS WILL BE USED TO MEASURE THRUST. THESE DATA WILL PRESENT A MORE COMPLETE PICTURE OF MAGNETIC NOZZLE PERFORMANCE THAN HAS BEEN GATHERED IN PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTS. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE EXPERIMENTAL WORK  NUMERICAL STUDIES WILL BE PERFORMED USING PLASMA SIMULATION CODES DEVELOPED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN IN PARTNERSHIP WITH NASA. THE COMBINATION OF THE EXPERIMENTAL AND NUMERICAL WORK WILL THEN BE COMPARED TO PREVIOUS MAGNETIC NOZZLE EXPERIMENTS  AND THE RESULTS WILL BE USED TO REFINE MAGNETIC NOZZLE THEORY. FINALLY  A NEW MAGNETIC NOZZLE EXPERIMENT WILL BE DEVELOPED AND TESTED IN ORDER TO VERIFY OUR HYPOTHESES. DEVELOPING A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF MAGNETIC NOZZLE PHYSICS WILL PROVIDE CRITERIA FOR FEASIBILITY AND OPTIMIZATION OF MAGNETIC NOZZLES FOR A VARIETY OF MISSIONS. ADDITIONALLY  PLASMA CONFINEMENT IN DIVERGING MAGNETIC FIELDS PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN PLASMA PROCESSING DEVICES  FUSION EXPERIMENTS  AND STELLAR PHYSICS.

SAND STORMS AND VOLCANIC ASH ARE AMONG EXAMPLES WIDELY OCCURRING IN NATURE. IN ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS, DUSTY FLOWS MAY REPRESENT SIGNIFICANT OPERATING AND SAFETY CHALLENGES. DUST CLOUDS KICKED UP BY ROTARY AIRCRAFTS IN GROUND PROXIMITY MAY REDUCE VISIBILITY, DAMAGE BLADES, AND LEAD TO ENGINE DEGRADATION. DUST CLOUDS KICKED UP BY THRUSTERS ON PLANETARY LANDING MODULES ARE KNOWN TO INTERFERE WITH ON-BOARD TELEMETRY, CREATE ELECTROSTATIC HAZARD, AND LEAD TO UNEVEN LANDING SURFACES. DUE TO LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE FEEDBACK FORCE FROM MICRON-SIZED PARTICLES ALTERS THE CARRIER FLOW, PREDICTING THE EVOLUTION OF SEMI-DILUTE DUST CLOUDS, SUCH AS THOSE ENCOUNTERED IN ENGINEERING, REMAINS A CHALLENGE. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL ENABLE PREDICTIVE MODELS OF SEMI-DILUTE DUST CLOUD, SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF PLANETARY LANDING MODULES, SCIENCE MISSIONS RELYING ON ROBOTIC HELICOPTERS TO EXPLORE AND COLLECT SOIL SAMPLES, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF MITIGATION STRATEGIES FOR ROTARY AIRCRAFTS OPERATING IN DESERT CONDITIONS.

HOWEVER  THESE AIRCRAFT PRESENT NEW CHALLENGES  SINCE POWER SYSTEM AND THERMAL MANAGEMENT DESIGN MUST BE CONSIDERED AT AN EARLY PHASE. ELECTRIC PROPULSION SYSTEMS OFFER SUPERIOR THERMAL EFFICIENCY COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL PROPULSION  BUT DO NOT OFFER A BUILT-IN MECHANISM TO REJECT EXCESS HEAT IN TO THE ATMOSPHERE  POTENTIALLY LEADING TO REDUCED SUBSYSTEM PERFORMANCE OR FAILURE DUE TO OVERHEATING. THIS HEAT REJECTION PROBLEM IS FURTHER AMPLIFIED BY SEVERE RESTRICTIONS ON THE OPERATING TEMPERATURE OF ELECTRIC PROPULSION COMPONENTS. THERMAL MANAGEMENT IS ALSO COUPLED TO THE OPERATIONAL AND MISSION ASPECTS OF THE VEHICLE  NECESSITATING A SYSTEM-LEVEL STUDY OF THESE IMPACTS. DUE TO THE WEIGHTCRITICAL NATURE OF DISTRIBUTED ELECTRIC VEHICLES  PARTICULARLY BATTERY-ELECTRIC CONCEPTS  ADDING EXTERNAL HEAT EXCHANGERS IS SUBOPTIMAL DUE TO THE WEIGHT AND DRAG IMPACT. DESIGNING MULTIFUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS  LIKE FOR EXAMPLE  A LOAD-CARRYING HEAT EXCHANGER  HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ELIMINATE WEIGHT PENALTIES. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES  WE WILL FOCUS OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ON THREE SEPARATE THRUST AREAS: (1) THERMO-MECHANICAL DESIGN OF ADVANCED LOAD-CARRYING THERMAL MANAGEMENT SUBSYSTEM COMPONENTS  (2) PRELIMINARY SYSTEMLEVEL DESIGN TOOLS FOR THE THERMAL SUBSYSTEM OF DISTRIBUTED ELECTRIC PROPULSION AIRCRAFT  AND (3) A COUPLED AERO-THERMO-MECHANICAL OPTIMIZATION TOOL THAT COUPLES AERODYNAMIC  THERMAL  AND MECHANICAL PERFORMANCE. THE FIRST THRUST AREA WILL BE ADDRESSED THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A HIGH-RESOLUTION TOPOLOGY OPTIMIZATION TOOL FOR THE DESIGN OF NOVEL THERMAL-ELASTIC STRUCTURES WITHIN TACS  AN OPEN SOURCE FINITE-ELEMENT DESIGN CODE. THIS TOPOLOGY OPTIMIZATION TOOL WILL ENABLE A BROAD EXPLORATION OF ELECTRIC PROPULSION STRUCTURES THAT SERVE A DUAL ROLE OF CARRYING MECHANICAL LOADS  WHILE ALSO SERVING A HEAT-TRANSFER FUNCTION. A NEW PRELIMINARY THERMAL AND POWERSYSTEM PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT AND DESIGN TOOL WILL BE INTEGRATED WITHIN THE MISSION ANALYSIS CAPABILITIES WITHIN OPENMDAO TO ADDRESS THE SECOND THRUST AREA.

ENGINEERED IMMUNE CELLS HAVE THE CAPACITY TO TREAT PATIENTS WITH RELAPSING OR REFRACTORY CANCERS. HOWEVER, ANTIGEN-DIRECTED THERAPIES LIKE CAR T-CELL THERAPY HAVE SHOWN LIMITED EFFICACY IN SOME ADVANCED CANCERS DUE TO THE HIGHLY IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE MICROENVIRONMENT OF SOLID TUMORS, EXPRESSION OF IMMUNE CHECKPOINTS, AND LACK OF TUMOR-ASSOCIATED ANTIGENS. THUS, THERE IS A NEED FOR THERAPIES THAT ARE AGNOSTIC TO THE EXPRESSION OF TUMOR- ASSOCIATED ANTIGENS AND THAT SENSITIZE SOLID TUMORS TO ESTABLISHED ANTIGEN-DIRECTED THERAPIES. TO MEET THIS IMPORTANT NEED, WE WILL DEVELOP AN ADOPTIVE CELLULAR TRANSFER TECHNOLOGY TO DELIVER A CLASS OF PROPULSIVE NANOPARTICLES TO SOLID TUMORS. DELIVERY OF NANOPARTICLES INSIDE OF MACROPHAGES WILL INCREASE THEIR ACCUMULATION WITHIN TUMORS AND REDUCE OFF-TARGET TOXICITY. ONCE LOCALIZED, THE HIGHLY POROUS DESIGN OF THE SILICA NANOPARTICLES PROMOTES THE NUCLEATION AND GROWTH OF BUBBLES ON THEIR SURFACES TO GUIDE THEIR RAPID AND EFFICIENT PENETRATION THROUGH DENSE TUMOROUS TISSUE IN RESPONSE TO HIGH-INTENSITY FOCUSED ULTRASOUND (HIFU). BY LOADING IMMUNOMODULATORY DRUGS THAT STIMULATE MACROPHAGES INTO THE NANOPARTICLES, WE WILL SIMULTANEOUSLY LYSE CANCER CELLS AND REPOLARIZE A LARGE VOLUME OF NEIGHBORING TUMOR-ASSOCIATED MACROPHAGES (TAMS) TOWARD ANTITUMOR PHENOTYPES, PROVIDING AMPLIFIED STIMULATION OF THE TUMOR IMMUNE MICROENVIRONMENT. THE UNIQUE COMBINATION OF PARTICLE PROPULSION AND ENHANCED TRANSPORT OF DRUGS WILL MAXIMIZE THE REPOLARIZATION OF TAMS AND EVENTUALLY OTHER IMMUNE CELLS BY THE INCLUSION OF DIFFERENT DRUGS. IN THIS R21 PROJECT, OUR PRIMARY GOALS ARE TO VALIDATE THE BIODISTRIBUTION, PROPULSION, AND IMMUNOMODULATORY EFFECTS OF THE NANOPARTICLES IN MURINE 4T1 MAMMARY CARCINOMA MODELS, WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO LATER STUDY THE CAPABILITIES OF THIS TECHNOLOGY IN OTHER AGGRESSIVE TUMOR MODELS. THE OUTCOME OF THIS WORK WILL BE AN ADOPTIVE CELL TRANSFER TECHNOLOGY TO DELIVER PROPULSIVE NANOPARTICLES FOR TREATING SOLID TUMORS THAT ARE WEAKLY IMMUNOGENIC IN A WAY THAT IS EXTENDABLE TO A VARIETY OF CANCERS. FEASIBILITY FOR THIS WORK IS SUPPORTED BY THE EXPERTISE OF THE PIS: NANOSCALE INTERFACIAL ENGINEERING (GOODWIN) AND ADOPTIVE MACROPHAGE TRANSFERS TO SOLID TUMORS (SHIELDS) FOR A MULTIPRONGED APPROACH TO STIMULATE TAMS AND EVENTUALLY OTHER TUMOR-ASSOCIATED IMMUNE CELLS. WE WILL DEVELOP THIS TECHNOLOGY THROUGH THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) DESIGN PARTICLES FOR CAVITATION-BASED DRUG RELEASE IN MACROPHAGES. 2) UNDERSTAND EFFECTS OF FOCUSED ULTRASOUND ON ACOUSTICALLY TRIGGERED NANOPARTICLES ON TUMOR SPHEROID MODELS. AND 3) EVALUATE THE THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL OF MACROPHAGE-MEDIATED TRANSPORT OF PARTICLES TO TUMORS AFTER ULTRASOUND STIMULATION.",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,H,PUBLIC/STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_R21CA267608_7529/,2022-07-21 13:20:24.807976+00

CURRENTLY, THERE IS NO VIABLE PROPULSION SYSTEM FOR SATELLITES AND INTERPLANETARY SPACECRAFT THAT ONLY USE THE SPACECRAFT POWER BUS TO GENERATE PROPULSION. PLUS, NO ENERGY STORAGE DEVICES CAN DIRECTLY USE AMPERE TENSION FORCES IN SOLID NON-ELASTIC MATERIALS TO STORE ENERGY OR STRENGTHEN THE MATERIAL. CURRENTLY, FEASIBLE METHODS FOR LAUNCHING SPACECRAFT INTO AN ORBIT REQUIRE LARGE AMOUNTS OF STORED ENERGY AS COMBUSTIBLE FUEL TO GET SPACECRAFT INTO SPACE.

THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE IS BEING PHASED OUT AND REPLACED BY ELECTRICITY, SETTING THE STAGE FOR AN INCREASED DEMAND FOR AUTONOMOUS AND EV TECHNOLOGIES. THIS CHANGING TECHNOLOGICAL CLIMATE AND THE RESULTANT CONCURRENT GLOBAL COMPETITION NECESSITATE TRANSFORMATION AT EVERY LEVEL OF AUTOMOTIVE DEVELOPMENT ? FROM EV DESIGNERS TO EV TECHNICIANS. THE DEMAND FOR SKILLED EV MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRY TECHNICIANS IS SUBSTANTIAL AND IS PREDICTED TO INCREASE AT A RATE WHERE DEMAND OUTPACES QUANTITY. WORKERS AGING OUT OF THE WORKFORCE, THE LACK OF ADVANCED STEM SKILLS FOR THOSE CURRENTLY IN THE WORKFORCE, AND INCREASED ECONOMIC EXPANSION ARE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THIS DEFICIT. COLLABORATION AMONG EDUCATORS AND EMPLOYERS MUST OCCUR TO ADVANCE THE UNDERSTANDING OF WORKFORCE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES. TO MEET THE NEED, A FACULTY-DRIVEN CONSORTIUM OF TWO-YEAR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION (IHES), OTHER ATE PROJECTS AND CENTERS, AND INDUSTRY WILL COLLABORATE TO ADDRESS THE NEXT GENERATION CROSS-DISCIPLINARY WORKFORCE NEEDS OF THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE (EV) MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRY THROUGH AN INNOVATIVE HYBRID VIRTUAL AND AUGMENTED REALITY (VR/AR) EDUCATION APPROACH. THE CONSORTIUM PROJECT PARTNERS INCLUDE: VOLVO, DAIMLER, BMW, PROTERRA, BOSCH, DUKE ENERGY, MICHELIN, THE UPSTATE SC ALLIANCE, THE SOUTH CAROLINA MANUFACTURING EXTENSION PARTNERSHIP, THE SOUTH CAROLINA TECHNICAL COLLEGE SYSTEM, THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR AUTONOMOUS TECHNOLOGIES, THE NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY TRAINING AND EDUCATION CENTER, THE REGIONAL CENTER FOR NUCLEAR EDUCATION, AND THE NORTHWEST ENGINEERING AND VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY EXCHANGE. THE PROJECT GOALS WILL ADDRESS CURRENT AND FUTURE EV MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRY NEEDS FOR BOTH TWO-YEAR COLLEGE STUDENTS AND INCUMBENT WORKERS. GOAL 1: IDENTIFY CURRENT AND FUTURE EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE NEEDS REQUIRED BY THE MIGRATION OF THE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY FROM TRADITIONAL FUELS TO BATTERY-POWERED ELECTRIC VEHICLES. GOAL 2: CREATE, DEPLOY, AND ASSESS AN INNOVATIVE, CREATIVE, AND INFORMED CROSS- DISCIPLINARY EV MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRY TECHNICIAN EDUCATION HYBRID CURRICULA INCORPORATING CLASSROOM, VIRTUAL, AND EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING. STRATEGIES WILL BE IMPLEMENTED TO SUPPORT PARTICIPATION AND PERSISTENCE IN EV MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE TECHNICIAN EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE RURAL, VETERANS, AND THOSE HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED IN STEM CAREER PATHWAYS. GOAL 3: DEVELOP AND/OR STRENGTHEN PARTNERSHIPS WITH CONSORTIUM MEMBERS, ATE PROJECTS AND CENTERS, AND INDUSTRY TO LEVERAGE AND SHARE EXPERTISE AND BEST PRACTICES FOR MAXIMUM IMPACT AND SUSTAINABILITY WITHIN AND ACROSS FIELDS AND INSTITUTIONS. GOAL 4: PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ADDRESSING THE NEW EV CURRICULA TO ENSURE WIDESPREAD USE, DISSEMINATION, AND FACULTY LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT.

THERE HAS BEEN AN EXTENSIVE EFFORT IN THE LAST TWO DECADES TO DEVELOP MEDICAL SIMULATORS FOR TRAINING SURGEONS. HOWEVER, MUCH OF THE WORK HAS FOCUSED ON MEDICAL STUDENTS AND SURGICAL RESIDENTS WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN FORMAL TRAINING PROGRAMS. THERE IS A RECOGNIZED NEED TO ENSURE PRACTICING SURGEONS MAINTAIN THEIR LEVEL OF SKILLS THROUGH CONTINUOUS EVALUATION WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY LEARNING NEWER PROCEDURES OR EQUIPMENT THAT GET ADOPTED INTO THE OR. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP, EVALUATE AND VALIDATE SIMULATION TECHNOLOGIES TO TRAIN, RETRAIN AND ADVANCE THE PERFORMANCE AND RESILIENCY OF PRACTICING SURGEONS. WE PLAN TO DEVELOP OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE TEMPLATES FOR RAPID CREATION OF HIGH-FIDELITY SIMULATIONS THAT INCLUDE RARE AND ADVERSE SURGICAL EVENTS TO ENABLE PRACTICING SURGEONS MAINTAIN AND ENHANCE THEIR SURGICAL SKILL.  IN THIS PROJECT, WE PROPOSE EXTENDING INTERACTIVE MEDICAL SIMULATION TOOLKIT (IMSTK)-AN OPEN SOURCE MEDICAL SIMULATION PLATFORM, THAT HAS BEEN USED TO PROTOTYPE VIRTUAL TRAINERS FOR LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY, ORTHOGNATHIC SURGERY AND OTHER CLINICAL APPLICATIONS. WE WILL DEVELOP SOFTWARE TEMPLATES FOR RARE AND ADVERSE EVENT SIMULATION, INCLUDING HEMORRHAGE (DUE TO VESSEL PUNCTURE AND UNINTENTIONAL CUTTING), THERMAL INJURY, ANATOMICAL VARIATION, AND PHYSIOLOGICAL MODELING. IN MOST CASES, PHYSIOLOGICAL MODELS ARE DEVELOPED SEPARATELY WITHOUT COORDINATION WITH INTERACTIVE SURGICAL SIMULATION LIMITING THEIR CAPABILITY. IN THIS PROJECT, WE WILL INTEGRATE KITWARE’S OPEN SOURCE PULSE PHYSIOLOGICAL ENGINE WITH IMSTK TO BUILD A CLOSED-LOOP PHYSIOLOGY MODEL THAT HANDLES LOCAL PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES AND GLOBAL, SYSTEMIC PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES.

AND THE UNIVERSITY AT BUFFALO SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES (UB) WITH AN END-USER ADVISORY GROUP (EAG) FROM CHILDREN NATIONAL MEDICAL CENTER (CNMC) AND BAYLOR UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER (BUMC). THE INSTITUTES HAVE A LONG RECORD OF COLLABORATION IN SIMULATION TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. WE WILL DEMONSTRATE THE NEW SOFTWARE TEMPLATES BY BUILDING A VIRTUAL SURGICAL SIMULATOR FOR CHOLECYSTECTOMY WITH BILE-DUCT INJURY AND OTHER COMPLICATIONS THAT CAN OCCUR IN THIS TYPE OF SURGERY.

TMS INDUCES ELECTRIC FIELDS (E-FIELDS) IN THE INTRACRANIAL TISSUE BY MEANS OF TIME-VARYING MAGNETIC FIELDS (ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION) THAT RESULTS IN THE POSSIBILITY OF OBTAINING SUPRATHRESHOLD STIMULATION INTENSITIES SAFELY AND WITH LITTLE DISCOMFORT TO THE SUBJECTS. CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF TMS INCLUDE MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD) AND TREATMENT RESISTANT DEPRESSION (TRD) IN WHICH REPETITIVE TMS (RTMS) IS ADMINISTERED TO DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX (DLPFC) WITH WELL-DEMONSTRATED EFFICACY. BOTH IN CLINICAL AND BASIC NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH APPLICATIONS, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE STIMULATION IS ACCURATELY TARGETED TO THE DESIRED REGION(S). THE E-FIELD DISTRIBUTION THAT IS INDUCED BY THE TMS PULSE IN THE INTRACRANIAL TISSUE IS THE KEY PHYSICAL QUANTITY THAT CAN BE USED TO DELINEATE WHICH AREAS ARE STIMULATED AND WHICH ARE NOT. THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR NON-MOTOR REGIONS SUCH AS THE DLPFC BECAUSE A DIRECT PERIPHERAL MEASURE (E.G., ELECTROMYOGRAPHIC RESPONSE) CANNOT BE USED TO GUIDE THE STIMULATION. TO DATE, COMPUTATIONALLY ESTIMATED E- FIELD DISTRIBUTIONS HAVE BEEN USED IN “ONLINE” COMMERCIAL NEURONAVIGATION SYSTEMS TO GUIDE THE TMS COIL POSITIONING, BUT THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE SYSTEMS OFFER ONLY SPHERICALLY SYMMETRIC HEAD MODELS THAT CANNOT PROPERLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN TISSUE GEOMETRIES AND MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL TARGETING AND DOSING ERRORS. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE MOST ACCURATE COMPUTATIONAL METHODS FOR E-FIELD ESTIMATION ARE TOO SLOW TO ENABLE NEAR REAL TIME OPERATION. THEREFORE, NO TECHNIQUE EXISTS THAT HAS THE COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY TO ENABLE NEURONAVIGATION APPLICATIONS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME INCORPORATING HIGH LEVEL OF ANATOMICAL DETAIL AND NUMERICAL ACCURACY. TO REMOVE THIS EFFICIENCY VS. ACCURACY DILEMMA THAT IS CURRENTLY POSING A CRITICAL BARRIER FOR DEVELOPMENT OF MORE QUANTITATIVE TMS APPROACHES, WE PROPOSE TO USE OUR RECENTLY DEVELOPED BOUNDARY ELEMENT METHOD (BEM) BASED COMPUTATIONAL STRATEGY ACCELERATED BY THE FAST MULTIPOLE METHOD (FMM) THAT IS SUITABLE FOR BOTH ONLINE AND OFFLINE APPLICATION SCENARIOS. OUR APPROACH STARTS WITH DEVELOPING AN AUTOMATIC SEGMENTATION AND SURFACE GENERATION PIPELINE TO OBTAIN ACCURATE REPRESENTATIONS OF THE TISSUE CONDUCTIVITY BOUNDARIES USING INDIVIDUAL MRI DATA.

AMONG THE 30 MILLION AMERICANS WHO HAVE DM, MORE THAN 20 MILLION ALSO HAVE HTN. SELF- MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC CONDITIONS IS A PROMISING STRATEGY FOR PREVENTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADDITIONAL CO- OCCURRING DISEASES AND RESULTING IN REDUCED MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. SELF-MONITORING HEALTH INDICATORS (E.G., BLOOD PRESSURE [BP], GLUCOSE) IS A KEY COMPONENT OF SUCCESSFUL SELF-MANAGEMENT. THROUGH SELF-MONITORING, PATIENTS CAN RECOGNIZE PATTERNS IN THEIR HEALTH INDICATORS, OBTAIN MORE HEALTH INFORMATION, AND CHANGE HEALTH BEHAVIORS.  TO MEET THE SELF-MANAGEMENT NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH COMORBID DM AND HTN, WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A VOICE-ACTIVATED SELF-MONITORING (VOIS) SUPPORT APPLICATION ON A SMART SPEAKER PLATFORM THAT INCLUDES THREE TYPES OF FEARUES 1) SELF-MONITORING FEATURES, INCLUDING VOICE-ACTIVATED DATA ENTRY (I.E., GLUCOSE AND BP), SMART NOTES TO RECORD LIFESTYLE-RELATED EPISODES THAT COULD RESULT IN UNUSUAL VALUES OF BIOMARKERS, AND SMART SPEECH REMINDERS; 2) CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT FEATURES, INCLUDING AN EVIDENCE-BASED KNOWLEDGE BASE WITH AI ENGINE FOR DM AND FOR HTN, AND 3) SHARED DECISION-MAKING FEATURES, INCLUDING VISUALIZATION OF PATIENT DATA ON MULTIPLE PLATFORMS AND AN AUDIO BRIEFING OF PATIENT DATA ON A SMART SPEAKER.  WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT PATIENTS WITH COEXISTING DM AND HTN WILL USE THE CONVENIENT VOIS APP FOR ROUTINE SELF-MONITORING OF BIOMARKERS AND FOR RECORDING LIFESTYLE-RELATED EPISODES. OTHER HYPOTHESES ARE: (1) THE SYNTHESIZED PATIENT DATA PRODUCED BY THE VOIS APP WILL HELP PATIENTS BETTER UNDERSTAND THE STATUS OF THEIR CONDITIONS; AND (2) PATIENT-GENERATED DATA-SHARING VIA THE VOIS APP WILL HELP PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER, SET SHARED GOALS, AND CHOOSE PERSONALIZED CARE PLANS TO PROMOTE ADHERENCE TO TREATMENT.  BEFORE WE CAN VERIFY THE CLINICAL EFFICACY OF THIS THEORY-BASED MHEALTH SELF-MANAGEMENT INTERVENTION, WE FIRST NEED TO DEVELOP THE VOIS. THEREFORE, AIMS OF THIS STUDY ARE TO 1) DEVELOP THE VOIS APP INCLUDING THE THREE FEATURES; AND 2) TEST ACCEPTABILITY AND USABILITY OF THE VOIS APP IN THE LAB AND IN THE FIELD BY PATIENTS WITH COEXISTING DM AND HTN. FINDINGS FROM THIS PROJECT WILL ENHANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF USER-PERCEIVED ACCEPTANCE, USABILITY, AND SATISFACTION WITH THE VOIS APP. ADDITIONALLY, FINDINGS WILL BE USED TO GENERATE ANOTHER R21 APPLICATION TO MOVE THIS RESEARCH FORWARD THROUGH PILOT TESTING TO DETERMINE PRELIMINARY CLINICAL EFFICACY USING A RANDOMIZED DESIGN. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THIS PROJECT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCE RACIAL AND SOCIOECONOMIC DISPARITIES IN SELF-MONITORING AND OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS WITH DM AND HTN THAT ARE INDICATED BY DELAYED ACCESS TO CARE; AND INFORM THE REPLICATION OF THIS WORK FOR OTHER COEXISTING METABOLILC CHRONIC CONDITIONS.",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,H,PUBLIC/STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_R21NR019707_7529/,2022-07-21 13:20:24.807976+00

MONITORING GLOBAL HYDROLOGICAL CYCLES AND WATER RESOURCES  AND DEVELOPING A DETAILED UNDERSTANDING OF THE MOVEMENT  DISTRIBUTION AND AVAILABILITY OF WATER AND ITS VARIABILITY OVER TIME AND SPACE IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR NASA S DECADAL STRATEGY FOR EARTH OBSERVATION FROM SPACE. AN ASSOCIATED NEED IS THE MEASUREMENT OF LAND SURFACE DYNAMICS BY MONITORING THE CONTINUOUS VARIABILITY OF LAND SURFACE TEMPERATURE (LST). WHILE LEO HYPERSPECTRAL TIR OBSERVATIONS WILL ENABLE DETAILED MEASUREMENTS OF BOTH HYDROLOGICAL AND LST VARIABILITY  THE FOCUS WILL BE ON ENABLING AGRICULTURAL REMOTE SENSING. HYTI WILL BE DESIGNED TO INVESTIGATE THE FOLLOWING FOOD AND WATER SECURITY ISSUES: 1. MAPPING BOTH IRRIGATED AND RAINFED CROPLAND AREAS; 2. DETERMINING CROP WATER USE (ACTUAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION (ET)) OF MAJOR WORLD CROPS 3. ESTABLISHING CROP WATER PRODUCTIVITY (""CROP PER DROP"") OF MAJOR WORLD CROPS.

THE HAWAII SPACE FLIGHT LABORATORY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROGRAM MANAGEMENT  SYSTEM ENGINEERING AND EFFORTS IN ALL WBS ELEMENTS:1 THROUGH 11. NASA'S JET PROPULSION LABORATORY WILL SUPPLY THE BARRIER INFRARED DETECTOR (BIRD) FOCAL PLANE ARRAY (FPA) UNDER WBS ELEMENT 5. SARANIASAT INC. WILL SUPPORT THE SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY WBS ELEMENTS. THE HYTI TECHNOLOGIES TO BE SPACE VALIDATED FOR THE FIRST TIME VIA LEO FLIGHT ARE: 1. HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGER: THE HYTI HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGER INSTRUMENT WILL BE DESIGNED AND DEVELOPED BY HSFL AND HIGP. BOTH HSFL AND HIGP HAVE A WELL-ESTABLISHED TRACK RECORD OF DESIGNING AND SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATING STATE-OF-THE-ART SMALL SATELLITES AND IMAGING PAYLOADS RANGING FROM THE VISIBLE TO THE IR  INCLUDING COMPACT HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGING FOR REMOTE-SENSING OBSERVATIONS. BASED ON THE FABRY-PEROT INTERFEROMETER PRINCIPLE  THE HYTI HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGER IS A UNIQUE INSTRUMENT (TRL 5)  AND WILL DELIVER SPATIAL RESOLUTION SIMILAR TO CURRENT LANDSAT-8 PERFORMANCE  BUT WITH HIGHER SPECTRAL RESOLUTION. IN A 430 KM ORBIT  THE HYTI INSTRUMENT WILL HAVE GROUND RESOLUTION OF 60M FOR UP TO 50 SPECTRAL SAMPLES IN THE 8.0-10.7 MICRON RANGE  WITH A PEAK SNR OF ~500:1. HIGP HAS SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED THE PROPOSED  NO MOVING PARTS  HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGER FOR A WIDE RANGE OF DOD PROGRAMS  AS WELL AS FOR A NASA IIP. 2. TIR IMAGER FOCAL PLANE: THE HEART OF THE HYTI HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGER IS A 2 DIMENSIONAL  BIRD FPA DESIGNED AND DEVELOPED AT JPL. BIRD IMAGERS HAVE HIGH UNIFORMITY  LOW COST  LOW NOISE AND HIGHER OPERATING TEMPERATURES THAN PREVIOUSLY-FLOWN TIR FPAS. JPL WILL SUPPLY THE 2D FPA WITHIN AN INTEGRATED DEWAR COOLER ASSEMBLY TO HSFL. 3. HIGH-PERFORMANCE ONBOARD COMPUTING: ONBOARD COMPUTING HAS BEEN THE  HOLY GRAIL  OF SCIENTIFIC  REMOTE-SENSING MISSIONS. THE HIGH VOLUME OF RAW HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGERY JUSTIFIES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OBC. SARANIASAT INC. HAS DEVELOPED FAST  LOW COMPUTATIONAL  FOOTPRINT  ALGORITHMS FOR WEAK-SIGNAL DETECTION  SENSOR FUSION AND ORTHORECTIFICATION WHICH  WHEN OPERATING ON THE ADVANCED UNIBAP E2160 HETEROGENEOUS OBC PLATFORM  PROMISE TO ACHIEVE FAST TURNAROUND (WITHIN 24 HRS OF ACQUISITION) OF THE PROCESSED DATA AND PRODUCTS.

ACTIVE MATTER CONSISTS OF OBJECTS THAT USE ENERGY FROM THEIR ENVIRONMENT TO PERFORM SYSTEMATIC MOTION. THERE IS A WIDE RANGE OF EXAMPLES, CELLS, BACTERIA, ESPECIALLY PREPARED COLLOIDAL PARTICLES, AND MACROSCOPIC OBJECTS LIKE LIVE ANIMALS. DUE TO THE CONTINUOUS CONSUMPTION AND DISSIPATION OF ENERGY BY THEIR CONSTITUENTS, ACTIVE MATTER SYSTEMS CAN EXHIBIT FASCINATING PROPERTIES THAT ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF MORE FAMILIAR EQUILIBRIUM SYSTEMS. SZAMEL AND HIS GROUP WILL DEVELOP NEW METHODS TO STUDY THE PROPERTIES OF ACTIVE MATTER AND WILL ADVANCE THE FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF THESE PROPERTIES. SZAMEL'S RESEARCH PROJECTS WILL EXPOSE UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS TO A VARIETY OF ADVANCED SCIENTIFIC METHODS. SZAMEL AND HIS GROUP WILL DEVELOP AN OUTREACH ACTIVITY FOR HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE STUDENTS FOCUSING ON THE SCIENTIFIC AND HISTORICAL IMPORTANCE OF BROWNIAN MOTION, WHICH WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY SIMPLE PROJECTS. THE DESCRIPTION OF STATIC AND DYNAMIC BEHAVIOR OF ACTIVE MATTER IS AN OUTSTANDING SCIENTIFIC CHALLENGE, WHICH HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE UNDERSTANDING OF BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS AND THE DESIGN OF BIO-INSPIRED MATERIALS. SZAMEL AND HIS GROUP WILL DERIVE AND TEST EFFICIENT COMPUTER SIMULATION METHODS TO STUDY RHEOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF ACTIVE MATTER. NEXT, THEY WILL FURTHER DEVELOP THE STOCHASTIC THERMODYNAMICS OF ACTIVE MATTER. THEY WILL USE IT TO DEVELOP FEEDBACK CONTROL PROTOCOLS FOR SINGLE ACTIVE PARTICLE ENGINES. FINALLY, SZAMEL AND HIS GROUP WILL ELUCIDATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LONG-RANGE EQUAL TIME VELOCITY CORRELATIONS, WHICH SPONTANEOUSLY ARISE IN SYSTEMS OF SELF-PROPELLED PARTICLES WITHOUT EXPLICIT VELOCITY ALIGNING INTERACTIONS.

MOLECULAR SIMULATIONS HAVE BECOME AN INVALUABLE TOOL FOR RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT IN CHEMICAL, PHARMACEUTICAL, AND MATERIALS SCIENCES. WITH THE AVAILABILITY OF SPECIALIZED HARDWARE SUCH AS GRAPHICS PROCESSING UNITS (GPUS), MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS USING CLASSICAL OR MOLECULAR MECHANICAL FORCE FIELDS HAVE REACHED THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES NEEDED TO ADDRESS IMPORTANT REAL-WORLD PROBLEMS IN THE CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES. FREE ENERGY SIMULATIONS ARE A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AND CHALLENGING CLASS OF MOLECULAR SIMULATIONS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO GAIN A PREDICTIVE UNDERSTANDING OF CHEMICAL PROCESSES. FOR EXAMPLE, FREE ENERGY METHODS CAN PREDICT THE BARRIER HEIGHT AND RATES FOR CHEMICAL REACTIONS, WHETHER A REACTION WILL OCCUR, OR HOW TIGHTLY A DRUG BINDS TO A TARGET. THESE PREDICTIONS ARE EXTREMELY VALUABLE FOR THE DESIGN OF NEW CATALYTIC AGENTS OR DRUGS. HOWEVER, THE PREDICTIVE CAPABILITY OF FREE ENERGY SIMULATIONS IS SENSITIVE TO THE UNDERLYING MODEL THAT DESCRIBES THE INTER-ATOMIC POTENTIAL ENERGY AND FORCES. ACCURATE FREE ENERGY SIMULATIONS OF CHEMICAL PROCESSES REQUIRE POTENTIAL ENERGY MODELS THAT CAPTURE THE ESSENTIAL PHYSICS AND CAN RESPOND TO CHANGES IN THE CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT, BUT CONVENTIONAL FORCE FIELD MODELS ARE UNSUITABLE FOR MANY PROCESSES INVOLVING BOND BREAKING AND FORMATION AS SEEN, FOR EXAMPLE, IN CATALYST DESIGN. CONSEQUENTLY, THERE IS GREAT NEED TO EXTEND THE SCOPE OF FREE ENERGY METHODS BY ENABLING THE USE OF A BROADER RANGE OF POTENTIAL ENERGY MODELS THAT ARE MORE ACCURATE AS WELL AS REACTIVE AND/OR CAPABLE OF QUANTUM MECHANICAL MANY-BODY POLARIZATION AND CHARGE TRANSFER. THE CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE CREATED BY THIS PROJECT ALLOWS FOR THE ROUTINE APPLICATION OF FREE ENERGY METHODS, USING QUANTUM MECHANICS, MACHINE LEARNING, REACTIVE AND CLASSICAL POTENTIALS TO A MYRIAD OF IMPORTANT PROBLEMS THAT ADVANCE THE STATE-OF-THE ART IN THE BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL SCIENCES. THE TOOLS CAN BE APPLIED BY A RANGE OF SCIENTISTS TO ADDRESS FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS OF NATIONAL INTEREST, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE DESIGN OF DRUGS AGAINST ZOONOTIC DISEASES (E.G., COVID-19), THE DESIGN OF MATERIALS WITH NOVEL FUNCTIONS AND IN THE DESIGN OF IMPROVED BATTERIES. GIVEN THE SOPHISTICATION OF THE METHODS EMPLOYED, EDUCATION OF A DIVERSE POOL OF CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND COMPUTER SCIENTISTS TO ADVANCE THIS FIELD IS ESSENTIAL AND IS ADDRESSED IN THIS PROJECT, THEREBY TRAINING THE NEXT GENERATION OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENTISTS THAT WILL FORM THE BACKBONE OF THE WORK FORCE OF THE FUTURE. THE PROJECT DEVELOPS ACCURATE AND EFFICIENT FREE ENERGY SOFTWARE WITHIN A POWERFUL NEW MULTISCALE MODELING FRAMEWORK IN THE AMBER SUITE OF PROGRAMS FOR APPLICATIONS IN CHEMISTRY, BIOLOGY, AND MATERIALS SCIENCE. THE MULTISCALE FRAMEWORK ENABLES THE DESIGN AND USE OF NEW CLASSES OF MIXED-METHOD FORCE FIELDS THAT INVOLVE INTEROPERABILITY BETWEEN SEVERAL EXISTING AND EMERGING REACTIVE, MACHINE LEARNING AND QUANTUM MANY-BODY POTENTIALS. THESE POTENTIALS HAVE ENHANCED ACCURACY, ROBUSTNESS, AND PREDICTIVE CAPABILITY COMPARED TO CLASSICAL MOLECULAR MECHANICAL FORCE FIELDS AND ENABLE THE STUDY OF CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND CATALYSIS. THE CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORTS INNOVATIVE MULTI-LAYERED HYBRID POTENTIALS THAT CAN BE CUSTOMIZED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF COMPLEX APPLICATIONS IN BIOTECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT, ENZYME DESIGN AND DRUG DISCOVERY. A ROBUST ENDPOINT BOOK-ENDING APPROACH THAT LEVERAGES THE GPU-ACCELERATED CAPABILITY OF THE AMBER MOLECULAR DYNAMICS ENGINE IS USED TO REACH THESE GOALS. SPECIFICALLY, THE OPEN-SOURCE HIGH-PERFORMANCE SOFTWARE FOR FREE ENERGY SIMULATIONS IS DESIGNED FOR MULTI-LAYERED HYBRID POTENTIALS USING COMBINATIONS OF LINEAR-SCALING MANY-BODY QUANTUM MECHANICAL METHODS VIA THE GPU-ACCELERATED QUICK PACKAGE, SCALABLE REACTIVE REAXFF FORCE FIELDS VIA THE PUREMD PACKAGE, AS WELL AS THE RECENTLY DEVELOPED DEEPMD-SE, ANAKIN-ME (ANI) AND AP-NET FAMILIES OF MACHINE LEARNING POTENTIALS. THE CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE IS BUILT UPON THE EXISTING HIGH-PERFORMANCE CUDA MD ENGINE IN AMBER AND EXTENDS IT TO A BROAD RANGE OF GPU-ACCELERATED ARCHITECTURES USING INDUSTRY-STANDARD PROGRAMMING MODELS. SCALABILITY IS ENSURED USING INNOVATIVE PARALLEL ALGORITHMS. HIGH IMPACT IS ACHIEVED BY LEVERAGING AMBER'S BROAD USER BASE TO EXPAND THE SCOPE AND SUCCESS OF FE APPLICATIONS. IN THIS WAY, THE PROJECT LEVERAGES EXISTING RECOGNIZED CAPABILITIES AND ACTIVELY ENGAGES A DIVERSE TEAM OF COLLABORATORS AND THE BROADER MOLECULAR SIMULATIONS COMMUNITY. THE CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE DELIVERED BY THE PROJECT ENABLES A WIDE RANGE OF NEW AND ENHANCED APPLICATIONS FOR A BROAD COMMUNITY OF USERS IN ACADEMIA, INDUSTRY, AND NATIONAL LABORATORIES. THESE APPLICATIONS INCLUDE DRUG DISCOVERY, ENZYME CATALYSIS, AND BIOMATERIALS DESIGN. THE AMBER SUITE OF PROGRAMS HAS A LONG-STANDING EXTENSIVE WORLDWIDE USERBASE, AND IS WIDELY USED ON NATIONAL PRODUCTION CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE. THE ENHANCEMENT OF AMBER AS AN ESTABLISHED, PROVEN SUSTAINABLE, AND WIDELY USED PACKAGE WILL ENSURE THAT THE SOFTWARE HAS A BROAD IMPACT WELL BEYOND THE END OF THE PROJECT. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO TRAIN A DIVERSE POPULATION OF STUDENTS AND RESEARCHERS IN THEORY, PROGRAMMING, COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY/BIOLOGY, COMPUTER SCIENCE, SCIENTIFIC WRITING, AND COMMUNICATION.

A HUMAN- MARS MISSION REQUIRES THE DELIVERY OF A HIGH PAYLOAD FROM THE ENTRY INTERFACE AT A HYPERSONIC SPEED TO A PREFLIGHT-DESIGNATED SURFACE LOCATION AT NEAR-ZERO SPEED WITH PINPOINT PRECISION. THE SUPERSONIC RETRO-PROPULSION SYSTEM REQUIRED TO DECELERATE A HUMAN-SCALE VEHICLE CONSUMES SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PROPELLANT. IT BECOMES A CHALLENGING TASK TO ACHIEVE HIGH PRECISION LANDING WHILE MINIMIZING FUEL CONSUMPTION DURING THE POWERED DESCENT PHASE. MOREOVER  THE MULTI-PHASE OPERATION (ENTRY  DESCENT  AND LANDING)  NONLINEAR VEHICLE DYNAMICS  AND MISSION CONSTRAINTS MAKE IT EVEN MORE CHALLENGING TO GENERATE ONBOARD FUEL-OPTIMAL GUIDANCE MANEUVERS TO ACCOMPLISH THE MISSION. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A HIGHLY IMPLEMENTABLE GUIDANCE APPROACH THAT OPTIMIZES THE END-TO-END COMPLETE ENTRY  POWERED DESCENT  AND LANDING (EDL) TRAJECTORIES IN REAL-TIME TO ACHIEVE THE FUEL-OPTIMAL AND PRECISE LANDING. IN PURSUIT OF THIS GOAL  THREE ESSENTIAL RESEARCH OBJECTIVES WILL BE INVESTIGATED  INCLUDING (1) DEVELOPING HIGH FIDELITY AND COMPUTATIONALLY EFFICIENT MISSION MODELS WITH BOTH CONVENTIONAL BANK-ANGLE CONTROL AND DIRECT-FORCE CONTROL MANEUVERS FOR ENTRY FLIGHT  (2) DESIGNING A FAST CONVERGING ONLINE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM BASED ON ADVANCED COMPUTATIONAL TECHNIQUES  AND (3) CONDUCTING VIRTUAL SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION  WHICH WILL JOINTLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE ADVANCES OF FUEL-OPTIMAL ENTRY AND DESCENT GUIDANCE ALGORITHMS TO ENABLE PRECISE LANDING. THE END-TO-END ONBOARD OPTIMAL MISSION PLANNING IS THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO SOLVE MULTIPHASE GUIDANCE PROBLEMS AS AN ENTIRE MISSION BASED ON A ROBUST AND SCALABLE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM. THE APPROACH WILL START WITH A NEW MODELING PARADIGM THAT UNIFIES MATHEMATICAL REPRESENTATIONS OF BOTH ENTRY AND POWERED DESCENT GUIDANCE PROBLEMS INTEGRATING VEHICLE DYNAMICS IN EACH PHASE  TRAJECTORY AND OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS  AND LANDING PRECISION REQUIREMENTS. THIS UNIQUE MODEL WILL INCORPORATE DIRECT CONTROL OF AERODYNAMIC FORCES IN ENTRY FLIGHT THROUGH MODULATIONS OF ANGLE OF ATTACK AND SIDESLIP ANGLE TO ACHIEVE ADVANCED MOBILITY. A THREE-DEGREE-OF-FREEDOM MODEL BASED ON SPHERICAL ELEMENTS WILL BE CONSTRUCTED FIRST AND THEN EXPANDED TO A SIX-DEGREE-OF-FREEDOM MODEL BASED ON DUAL QUATERNIONS CONSIDERING COUPLED TRANSLATIONAL AND ROTATIONAL MOTIONS. THE ONBOARD MISSION PLANNING SCHEME AIMS TO OPTIMIZE THE ENTIRE EDL TRAJECTORY AS A WHOLE  INCLUDING DESIGNING SIMULTANEOUSLY OPTIMAL MANEUVERS IN EACH PHASE AND SELECTING AN IDEAL INITIATION OF POWERED DESCENT. TO OVERCOME THE COMPUTATIONAL BOTTLENECK IN SOLVING LARGE-SCALE NONCONVEX OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS  THE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM WILL LEVERAGE BREAKTHROUGHS IN MATRIX DECOMPOSITION  ALTERNATING MINIMIZATION  AND CUTTING PLANE METHODS TO ACHIEVE SCALABILITY AND ROBUST CONVERGENCE. THE PROPOSED MODELING AND OPTIMIZATION METHOD WILL BE EVALUATED VIA MONTE CARLO SIMULATION  IMPLEMENTATION IN AN EXPERIMENTAL TESTBED  AND FINAL ASSESSMENT IN NASA FLIGHT SIMULATIONS.

YET, ALTHOUGH, NEUROMODULATORS PRIMARILY SIGNAL THROUGH VOLUME TRANSMISSION WHICH REQUIRES THEM TO TRAVERSE THE EXTRACELLULAR SPACE (ECS) FROM RELEASE SITE TO TARGET RECEPTOR, NEUROMODULATORY DIFFUSION THROUGH THE ECS HAS RECEIVED LITTLE ATTENTION. WE KNOW FROM COMPUTATIONAL MODELS THAT ECS DIFFUSION IS DEPENDENT ON FACTORS SUCH AS VOLUME FRACTION, TISSUE TORTUOSITY AND ECS GEOMETRY. SIMULATIONS SO FAR HAVE MAINLY FOCUSED ON SYNAPTIC DIFFUSION AND SYNAPTIC SPILLOVER MECHANISMS WHEREAS NEUROMODULATION FUNCTIONS AT MUCH LARGER SPATIOTEMPORAL SCALES THAN THAT: EVEN NEUROMODULATOR DIFFUSION THROUGH JUST LAYER IV IN MACAQUE CORTEX, FOR EXAMPLE, REQUIRES MOLECULES TO TRAVEL DISTANCES UP TO 0.5 MM FROM RELEASE SITE TO TARGET RECEPTOR. FACTORS RELATED TO TISSUE POROSITY BECOME INCREASINGLY MORE IMPORTANT AT SUCH DISTANCES BUT CURRENT COMPUTER MODELS LIKE THE COMMON SIMULATION ENGINE MCELL ARE ONLY EQUIPPED TO STUDY MOLECULAR DIFFUSION AT THE NANOMETER SCALE. CONSEQUENTLY, WE NEED UPDATED COMPUTATIONAL MODELS CAPABLE OF SIMULATING THE DIFFUSION OF NEUROMODULATORS ACROSS GREATER SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RANGES CAPABLE OF INCORPORATING MEASURES THAT BECOME RELEVANT AT THAT MACROSCALE. FOR THIS, I PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A HYBRID MODEL WHICH WILL ACHIEVE THIS CRITICAL FUNCTIONALITY BY COMBINING EXISTING MCELL CAPABILITIES WITH LARGE-SCALE ALGORITHMS FROM MODELS OF BULK DIFFUSION. BECAUSE ECS DIFFUSION IS THOUGHT TO VARY WITH BRAIN REGIONS WHICH TO DATE HAS NOT BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY EVALUATED, I WILL THEN, WITH THIS MULTISCALE MODEL, SIMULATE DIFFUSION OF ACETYLCHOLINE, NORADRENALINE, AND DOPAMINE ACROSS DIFFERENT REGIONS OF MACAQUE CORTEX TO TEST HOW FACTORS SUCH AS TISSUE GRANULARITY OR TISSUE ANISOTROPY AFFECT COMMON DIFFUSION METRICS (E.G., CONCENTRATIONS, DIFFUSION RATES, EFFECTIVE DIFFUSION COEFFICIENTS, AND DIFFUSION TENSOR). SINCE NEUROMODULATORY NETWORKS HAVE BEEN LINKED TO VIRTUALLY EVERY BRAIN FUNCTION, UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMICS OF NEUROMODULATOR DIFFUSION ACROSS THE BRAIN IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN UNDERSTANDING NORMAL BRAIN FUNCTION. FURTHERMORE, BECAUSE CHANGES IN ECS DYNAMICS AND IN NEUROMODULATORY SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED THROUGHOUT DEVELOPMENT AND NORMAL AGING OR WITH NEUROPATHOLOGY LIKE STROKE-RELATED ISCHEMIA AND DEMENTIA, IDENTIFYING KEY PARAMETERS THAT DETERMINE SIGNALING OUTCOMES, BUT ALSO THE ACTIVE PROCESSES BY WHICH THEY CAN BE MODIFIED, MAY BE KEY FOR THE ADVANCEMENT IN DIAGNOSTICS AND THERAPEUTICS.",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,O,PRIVATE INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_F32NS129585_7529/,2022-10-05 19:45:46.593103+00

BESIDES BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE ACCURATE AND REPEATABLE DATA  THE SENSOR WILL BE DESIGNED TO UTILIZE LOW COST MATERIALS  BE BATCH FABRICATION-COMPATIBLE  AND REMAIN UNOBTRUSIVE TO FLOW OR TEST OPERATION DURING USE. THE SENSOR IS BASED ON THE STRATEGIC INTEGRATION OF HIGH TEMPERATURE-COMPATIBLE THIN FILM THERMOCOUPLES AND THERMOPILES ONTO CERAMIC SUBSTRATES USING INDUSTRY-STANDARD MICROFABRICATION PROCESSES. THIS APPROACH ALLOWS FOR BATCH-FABRICATION OF SMALL  LOW PROFILE  LOW COST SENSORS WHICH CAN BE UTILIZED ACROSS A WIDE VARIETY OF COMPONENTS AND ENVIRONMENTS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY DISRUPTING HEAT FLOW OR OPERATION. THE THERMOCOUPLE/THERMOPILE FEATURES WILL BE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE BOTH SURFACE TEMPERATURE AND SURFACE HEAT FLUX DATA SIMULTANEOUSLY. WHEN MULTIPLE SUCH SENSORS ARE PLACED AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS ON A COMPONENT OF INTEREST  TEMPERATURE GRADIENT INFORMATION MAY ALSO BE OBTAINED WITH MILLIMETER-SCALE RESOLUTION. UNLIKE PREVIOUS STUDIES ON THE USE OF THIN FILM THERMOCOUPLES FOR HIGH TEMPERATURE APPLICATIONS [1-4]  THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO DEVELOP A ROBUST THERMOMECHANICAL DESIGN WITH INTEGRATED SURFACE PATTERNING TO MINIMIZE THERMALLY-INDUCED STRESSES AND PREVENT DESTRUCTIVE CRACKING OR DELAMINATION. FURTHER DETAILS AS TO THE SENSOR FABRICATION  VALIDATION  AND TESTING PROCEDURES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPOSED WORK ARE PRESENTED IN SECTION III.  HIS PROJECT IS DIRECTLY ALIGNED WITH THE PROPULSION TESTING INSTRUMENTATION NEEDS AT NASA SSC  BOTH FOR USE ON SPACE FLIGHT COMPONENTS UNDER EVALUATION AS WELL AS ON CRITICAL TEST STAND INFRASTRUCTURE. IN ADDITION  THIS TECHNOLOGY WOULD BE HIGHLY ATTRACTIVE FOR MANY COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS SUCH AS NUCLEAR POWER  GAS TURBINES  AIRCRAFT ENGINES  AND INDUSTRIAL MANUFACTURING/PROCESSING SUCH THAT THERE IS A HIGH DEGREE OF COMMERCIALIZATION POTENTIAL AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION IV.

PART OF THE CLASS KNOWN AS FAST AND BLUE OPTICAL TRANSIENTS (FBOTS), THESE EVENTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BRIGHTER THAN A SUPERNOVA (SN), OR EXPLODING STAR, BUT BRIGHTEN WITHIN A FEW DAYS, MUCH FASTER THAN THE TENS OF DAYS TYPICAL FOR SUPERNOVAE. THEY ARE BELIEVED TO BE POWERED BY A NEWLY-BORN BLACK HOLE (BH) OR NEUTRON STAR (NS), WHICH IS A VERY COMPACT TYPE OF STAR. A RESEARCH TEAM BETWEEN NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO WILL STUDY THESE FBOTS WITH A COMBINATION OF TELESCOPE OBSERVATIONS AND THEORETICAL INVESTIGATIONS. THE RESEARCHERS EXPECT TO OBSERVE ABOUT FIVE FBOTS PER YEAR FROM NSF-FUNDED ASTRONOMICAL SURVEY TELESCOPES SUCH AS THE ZWICKY TRANSIENT FACILITY, ENABLING THEM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF STARS BECOME FBOTS AND HOW COMPACT OBJECTS LIKE NEUTRON STARS AND BLACK HOLES ARE FORMED. THE INVESTIGATORS WILL INTEGRATE THEIR RESEARCH WITH THREE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS: (I) PROVIDING SUMMER RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES TO UNDER-REPRESENTED MINORITY AND WOMEN UNDERGRADUATES; (II) WORK WITH CHICAGO-AREA HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS TO DEVELOP CURRICULAR MATERIAL ON STELLAR EXPLOSIONS FOR THEIR CLASSES; AND (III) WORK WITH VISUALLY IMPAIRED SCIENTISTS AND PROFESSIONAL MUSICIANS TO TRANSLATE ASTRONOMICAL MEASUREMENTS INTO SOUND. RECENT TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES HAVE REVOLUTIONIZED THE INVESTIGATIVE POWER OF OPTICAL ASTRONOMICAL TRANSIENT SURVEYS (E.G. PANSTARRS AND PTF), WHICH ALLOWED THE EXPLORATION OF UNCHARTED TERRITORIES OF THE PARAMETER SPACE, AND LED TO THE DISCOVERY OF NEW TYPES OF TRANSIENTS. AS THE RESEARCH TEAM SHOWED IN THEIR RECENT STUDY OF THE ASTRONOMICAL TRANSIENT AT 2018COW, THE LARGE FBOT LUMINOSITIES -- REACHING PEAK LUMINOSITIES OF ~4 X 10^44 ERG/S -- AND EXTREMELY SHORT RISE-TIMES OF A FEW DAYS - RULE OUT TRADITIONAL SN MODELS POWERED BY THE RADIOACTIVE DECAY OF 56NI , IMPLY SMALL EJECTA MASSES OF 0.1 TO 0.5 SOLAR MASSES, AND POINT AT THE PRESENCE OF A CENTRAL ENGINE IN THE FORM OF A NEWLY-BORN NS OR BH POWERING THE TRANSIENT'S DISPLAY. THE RADIO-TO-X-RAY EMISSION FROM AN FBOT PROVIDES AN UNPARALLELED OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY BHS AND NSS AT THE TIME OF THEIR FORMATION, A PHASE OF EVOLUTION THAT HAS BEEN HIDDEN TO OUR EYES SO FAR.

BUILDING ON THE NSF CIF21 VISION, THE EARTHCUBE PROGRAM WAS FORMED TO ADDRESS THE TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGES SURROUNDING DATA AND SOFTWARE WITHIN THE GEOSCIENCES. THROUGH EXTENSIVE INTERACTION WITH THE COMMUNITY THIS CULMINATED IN TWO KEY ACTIVITIES AROUND DATA DISCOVERY AND REUSE. FIRST, THE PROMOTION, REFINEMENT, AND ADOPTION OF SCHEMA.ORG TO ANNOTATE GEOSCIENCES METADATA WITHIN DISTRIBUTED REPOSITORIES SO THAT DATASETS CAN BE CRAWLED. SECOND, THE PROMOTION AND SUPPORT FOR THE ADOPTION OF NOTEBOOKS TO DOCUMENT, SHARE, AND REUSE SOFTWARE AS PEER REVIEWED SCHOLARLY OBJECTS. A RALLYING POINT AROUND THESE ACTIVITIES WAS THE GEOCODES PLATFORM, WHICH ALLOWS COMMUNITIES TO STAND UP INSTANCES OF SCIENTIFIC SEARCH ENGINES SPECIFIC TO THEIR DOMAINS, WHILE BUILDING A COMMUNITY OF GEOSCIENCE DATA USERS AND DEVELOPERS AND, ULTIMATELY, REDUCING THE TIME TO SCIENCE. THIS PROJECT WILL LEVERAGE THIS EFFORT IN THE DECODER PLATFORM TO ENABLE SIMILAR ACTIVITIES AND OUTCOMES ACROSS SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITIES.

DFD IS BASED ON THE PRINCETON FIELD-REVERSED CONFIGURATION (PFRC) FUSION REACTOR UNDER DEVELOPMENT AT THE PRINCETON PLASMA PHYSICS LABORATORY. THE MISSION CONTEXT WE ARE PROPOSING IS DELIVERY OF A PLUTO ORBITER WITH A LANDER. DFD PROVIDES HIGH THRUST TO ALLOW FOR REASONABLE TRANSIT TIMES TO PLUTO WHILE DELIVERING SUBSTANTIAL MASS TO ORBIT: 1000 KG DELIVERED IN 4 YEARS. SINCE DFD PROVIDES POWER AS WELL AS PROPULSION IN ONE INTEGRATED DEVICE  IT WILL ALSO PROVIDE AS MUCH AS 1 MW OF POWER TO THE PAYLOADS UPON ARRIVAL. THIS ENABLES HIGH-BANDWIDTH COMMUNICATION  POWERING OF THE LANDER FROM ORBIT  AND RADICALLY EXPANDED OPTIONS FOR INSTRUMENT DESIGN. THE DATA ACQUIRED BY NEW HORIZONS' RECENT PLUTO FLYBY IS JUST A TINY FRACTION OF THE SCIENTIFIC DATA THAT COULD BE GENERATED FROM AN ORBITER AND LANDER. ENGINE MODELING ACCOMPLISHED DURING PHASE I HAS SHOWN THAT WE CAN EXPECT 2.5 TO 5 N OF THRUST PER MEGAWATT OF FUSION POWER  WITH AN ISP OF ABOUT 10 000 SECONDS AND 200 KW AVAILABLE AS ELECTRICAL POWER. WE HAVE EVALUATED THE COMPONENTS OF THE PLUTO TRAJECTORY INCLUDING AN EARTH DEPARTURE SPIRAL  CONSTANT THRUST PLANAR TRANSFER  AND PLUTO INSERTION USING THESE THRUST AND ISP LEVELS  AND CONFIRMED THE PLAUSIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED MISSION. IN FACT  THE MISSION CAN DEPART FROM LEO WITH ABOUT THE MASS WE ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED FOR AN INTERPLANETARY INSERTION  WIDENING THE RANGE OF AVAILABLE LAUNCH VEHICLES AND REDUCING THE COST. THE KEY OBJECTIVE OF THE PHASE II PROPOSAL IS TO FURTHER ADVANCE THE DESIGN AND TRL OF SELECTED SUBSYSTEMS  SUCH AS THE SUPERCONDUCTING COILS  RF HEATING  AND SHIELDING. PPPL WILL PERFORM EXPERIMENTAL WORK ON THE EXISTING PFRC-2 TESTBED USING A GAS PUFF VALVE  TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE THE DYNAMICS OF THE THRUST AUGMENTATION SYSTEM (ADDITIONAL GAW FLOWING THROUGH THE FRC SCRAPE-OFFLAYER). WE WILL EXPLORE THE DESIGN OF A NO-THRUST MODE THAT CAPTURES AND REUSES THE PROPELLANT  POSSIBLY EXTRACTING MORE POWER WHILE IN ORBIT AROUND PLUTO. FINALLY  WE WILL DEVELOP A MODEL OF THE SYNCHROTRON RADIATION THAT IS SPECIFIC TO THE FRC CONFIGURATION  AS AVAILABLE MODELS ARE DERIVED FROM TOKAMAKS. DIRECT FUSION DRIVE IS A UNIQUE FUSION ENGINE CONCEPT WITH A PHYSICALLY FEASIBLE APPROACH THAT WOULD DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE CAPABILITY OF OUTER PLANET MISSIONS. THE FUSION-ENABLED PLUTO MISSION PROPOSED HERE IS CREDIBLE  EXCITING  AND THE BENEFITS TO THIS AND ALL OUTER PLANET MISSIONS ARE DIFFICULT TO OVERSTATE. THE TRULY GAME-CHANGING LEVELS OF THRUST AND POWER IN A MODESTLY SIZED PACKAGE COULD INTEGRATE WITH OUR CURRENT LAUNCH INFRASTRUCTURE WHILE RADICALLY EXPANDING THE SCIENCE CAPABILITY OF THESE MISSIONS.,NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,R,SMALL BUSINESS,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_80NSSC18K0040_8000/,2019-09-20 14:32:16.02888+00

POSTMORTEM BRAIN TISSUE IS USEFUL, BUT EXPENSIVE, RARE, AND CRITICALLY CONFOUNDED BY ANTEMORTEM AND AGONAL FACTORS. THESE TWO FACTS HAVE INSPIRED THE SEARCH FOR ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES, SUCH AS THE USE OF SURROGATE MARKERS LIKE BLOOD-BASED GENE EXPRESSION. TO IMPROVE THE RIGOR OF THIS WIDELY USED APPROACH, WE DEVELOPED A NOVEL COMPUTATIONAL METHOD CALLED THE BRAIN GENE EXPRESSION AND NETWORK IMPUTATION ENGINE (BRAINGENIE) THAT LEVERAGES BIOLOGICAL COMPARABILITY BETWEEN BLOOD AND BRAIN GENE EXPRESSION TO PREDICT TRANSCRIPTOME PROFILES FOR BRAIN TISSUE BASED ON BLOOD GENE-EXPRESSION PROFILES. BRAINGENIE IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER TRANSCRIPTOME-IMPUTATION METHODS, AND CAPTURES A MUCH LARGER PROPORTION OF THE VARIANCE IN—AND LARGER FRACTION OF—THE BRAIN TRANSCRIPTOME. BRAINGENIE IS CAPABLE OF PREDICTING APPROXIMATELY 9–57% OF THE BRAIN TRANSCRIPTOME, WHICH YIELDS AN APPROXIMATE 1.8-FOLD INCREASE IN COVERAGE RELATIVE TO THE “GOLD STANDARD” METHOD PREDIXCAN, AND WHICH GREATLY IMPROVES OUR STATISTICAL POWER TO DETECT GENES AND PATHWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH DISEASE. OUR PROPOSAL CONTAINS THREE SPECIFIC AIMS TO IMPROVE OUR METHOD AND SHED LIGHT ON BIOLOGICAL PATHWAYS UNDERLYING NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS. AIM 1: REFINE BRAINGENIE TO CAPTURE ADDITIONAL GENES THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY WELL PREDICTED BY OUR METHOD. AIM 2: APPLY BRAINGENIE TO OUR COLLECTION OF PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AND IN-HOUSE DATA TO PREDICT BRAIN-REGION-SPECIFIC GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES FOR OVER 8,000 LIVING PERSONS, AND DISCOVER REGION-SPECIFIC GENE-EXPRESSION PATTERNS ASSOCIATED WITH NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS AND NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES. AIM 3: DISSEMINATE BRAINGENIE AS STAND-ALONE SOFTWARE FOR OTHER RESEARCHERS TO USE FREELY. GUIDED BY RECENT GENETIC AND GENOMIC STUDIES, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT COMPARABLE PATTERNS OF GENE DYSREGULATION WILL BE FOUND ACROSS NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS AMONG PATHWAYS INVOLVING INNATE IMMUNITY, CHROMATIN REMODELING, NEURODEVELOPMENT, AND NEUROTRANSMISSION. INCLUSION OF NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS IN OUR ANALYSIS WILL ALLOW US TO DETERMINE WHETHER GENE EXPRESSION PATTERNS ARE SHARED ACROSS A BROADER RANGE OF BRAIN DISORDERS. WE ALSO EXPECT TO IDENTIFY DISORDER-SPECIFIC AND BRAIN-REGION-SPECIFIC TRANSCRIPTOMIC ASSOCIATIONS.

THE INCREASING FREQUENCY OF INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC PAIN AS THE RESULT OF CHRONIC DISEASES AND POSTOPERATIVE PAIN HAVE DIRECTLY LED, OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES, TO THE OVER-PRESCRIPTION AND MISUSE OF OPIOIDS. IN EARLY 2019, AN ESTIMATED 130 PEOPLE PER DAY WERE DYING FROM OPIOID- RELATED DRUG OVERDOSES, 2 MILLION PEOPLE WERE MISUSING FIRST-TIME OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS, AND ALMOST 33000 DEATHS WERE ATTRIBUTED TO OVERDOSING WITH SYNTHETIC NON-METHADONE OPIOIDS IN THE USA ALONE. EVEN THOUGH RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION AND COMPLETE RESPIRATORY ARREST ARE THE MAJOR CAUSES OF MORTALITY WITH OPIOID OVERDOSE, THERE IS CURRENTLY A SERIOUS KNOWLEDGE GAP IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS OF OPIOID PAIN RELIEF AND RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION BY OPIOIDS, AND HOW THESE MECHANISMS DIFFER FROM EACH OTHER.

COMPUTER MODELS ARE OFTEN USED TO SUPPORT DECISION-MAKING, FOR INSTANCE TO PROVIDE FORECASTS OF FUTURE TRANSMISSION OR TO UNDERSTAND HOW PUBLIC POLICIES MAY BE RECEIVED BY THE POPULATION. HOWEVER, INFECTIOUS DISEASE INTELLIGENCE SUFFERS FROM THE FACT THAT INFECTIOUS DISEASE MODELING IS LARGELY DISJOINTED BECAUSE MOST MODELS EXAMINE ONLY ONE OR TWO ASPECTS OF TRANSMISSION, WHEREAS EPIDEMICS AND PANDEMICS ARE COMPLICATED, MULTI-FACETED EVENTS THAT TOUCH ON MANY ASPECTS OF SOCIETY. FOR THIS REASON, INTELLIGENCE FOR PANDEMIC PREDICTION AND PREVENTION MUST BE A MULTIDISCIPLINARY ENDEAVOR THAT INTEGRATES DIVERSE THEORIES, CONCEPTS, AND FRAMEWORKS FROM THE NATURAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES, ALTHOUGH A FRAMEWORK FOR THIS INTEGRATION IS CURRENTLY LACKING. TO FILL THIS GAP, THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A SYSTEMS-OF-SYSTEMS (SOS) FRAMEWORK THAT ALLOWS THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED FROM DIFFERENT DISCIPLINARY APPROACHES TO BE INTEGRATED WITH ONE ANOTHER. ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES OF THIS FRAMEWORK INCLUDE IMPROVED SITUATION AWARENESS, REAL-TIME FORECASTING, RISK ANALYSIS, PUBLIC POLICY INTERVENTIONS, AND INDIVIDUAL DECISION-MAKING. THE SOS MODELING APPROACH WILL ADDRESS THE GRAND CHALLENGE OF MODELING INTERDEPENDENCE ACROSS SCALES BY ALLOWING FOR INTERACTIVE FEEDBACK THROUGH THE INTEGRATION OF INFORMATION FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES.

IF PLENTIFULLY-AVAILABLE IN CIS-LUNAR SPACE  WATER COULD BE USED DIRECTLY AS PROPELLANT IN SOLAR THERMAL ROCKETS (STRS) TO PROVIDE INEXPENSIVE TRANSPORTATION. THE LUNAR SURFACE HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS A SOURCE OF SUCH WATER  BUT INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS OF LUNAR ISRU SUGGESTS THAT IT WOULD NOT BE COST EFFECTIVE DUE TO THE SIZE  WEIGHT  POWER  AND COST (SWAP-C) OF ISRU EQUIPMENT  THE LARGE ROUND TRIP TO GET TO THE LUNAR SURFACE  AND THE LOGISTICAL ISSUES OF WORKING THERE.

WE UNDERSTAND WHY PAST ATTEMPTS HAVE FAILED AND WE OFFER AN INNOVATIVE NEW MISSION CONCEPT CALLED APIS. APIS HARVESTS AND RETURNS UP TO 100 TONNES OF WATER FROM A NEAR EARTH ASTEROID USING ONLY A SINGLE FALCON 9 V1.1 LAUNCH. APIS IS BASED ON A MAJOR NEW INNOVATION CALLED ""OPTICAL MINING"" THAT WE ARE PROPOSING HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME. OPTICAL MINING IS A NOVEL APPROACH TO EXCAVATING AND PROCESSING ASTEROID MATERIALS IN WHICH HIGHLY CONCENTRATED SUNLIGHT IS USED TO DRILL HOLES  EXCAVATE  DISRUPT  AND SHAPE AN ASTEROID WHILE THE ASTEROID IS INCLOSED IN A CONTINENT BAG. OPTICAL MINING IS ENABLED BY ADVANCED ANIDOLIC OPTICS THAT HAVE THUS FAR NOT BEEN CONSIDERED FOR ISRU APPLICATIONS. APIS FURTHER COMBINES THE MID-TRL TECHNOLOGIES OF THIN-FILM INFLATABLE STRUCTURES AND WATER SOLAR THERMAL PROPULSION WITH AN INNOVATIVE NEW TRL-1 SOLAR THERMAL OVEN TECHNOLOGY TO EXTRACT WATER FROM A VOLATILE-RICH ASTEROID.APIS MISSION OPERATIONS START WITH A FALCON 9 V1.1 OR EQUIVALENT LAUNCH TO A LOW C3 ARM-LIKE BUT VOLATILE-RICH NEO. ONCE AT THE TARGET  APIS USES AN INFLATABLE CAPTURE SYSTEM SIMILAR TO THAT PROPOSED FOR ARM  BUT FABRICATED FROM HIGH TEMPERATURE MATERIAL AND DESIGNED TO FULLY ENCLOSE THE TARGET. AFTER THE ASTEROID HAS BEEN ENCAPSULATED AND THE SYSTEM DE-SPUN  AN INFLATABLE SOLAR CONCENTRATOR IN AN ADVANCED NON-IMAGING CONFIGURATION  PROVIDES DIRECT SOLAR-THERMAL ENERGY THROUGH WINSTON CONES AND LIGHT TUBES TO THE ASTEROID SURFACE. THIS HEAT IS USED TO EXCAVATE THE ASTEROID AND FORCE THE WATER TO OUTGAS INTO THE ENCLOSING BAG AT A LOW PRESSURE OF 10-4 TO 10-5 ATM. THE OUTGASSING WATER IS CRYOPUMPED AT MODEST TEMPERATURE INTO A PASSIVELY-COOLED WATER STORAGE BAG AND STORED AS SOLID ICE. AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS OF COLLECTION  UP TO 120MT OF WATER ARE STORED. USING SOLAR THERMAL PROPULSION WITH SOME OF THE WATER AS THE PROPELLANT  THE APIS SYSTEM RETURNS THE HARVESTED WATER TO LUNAR DISTANT RETROGRADE ORBIT (LDRO) WHERE IT CAN SUPPORT A FAR MORE AFFORDABLE PROGRAM OF HUMAN EXPLORATION OF CIS-LUNAR SPACE.

SRS: U.S.-CHINA: INFRASTRUCTURE-DRIVEN DECISION SYSTEM FOR SUSTAINABLE AND EQUITABLE URBAN-RURAL DEVELOPMENT -2214872 (ZHAO). ELECTRIFICATION IS THE FUTURE FOR MUCH OF SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION, AND EXPANDED USE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES (EVS) IS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF FUTURE URBAN-RURAL SYSTEMS. EVS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY SUBSTANTIALLY, SINCE 29% OF U.S. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ARE FROM INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE VEHICLES (ICEVS). IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 18.7 MILLION EVS WILL BE ON U.S. ROADS BY 2030, WITH A 37% ANNUAL GROWTH. CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE IS CRITICAL TO THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF EV AND ITS UPSTREAM INDUSTRIES. A LACK OF CONVENIENT AND UBIQUITOUS CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE IS ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS THAT IMPEDES EV ADOPTION. INCREASING INVESTMENTS TO THE U.S. INFRASTRUCTURE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE RECENT $1.2 TRILLION INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND JOBS ACT, ENVISION AND PLAN A NETWORK OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF NEW CHARGING STATIONS ALONG ROADS AND HIGHWAYS BY 2030. INVESTMENTS IN CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE INVOLVE NOT ONLY FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC DECISIONS BUT ALSO SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL DECISIONS, AS THEY INFLUENCE REGIONAL SUSTAINABILITY AND EQUITY ACROSS URBAN AND RURAL AREAS. HOWEVER, CURRENT DECISION-MAKING MODELS AND TOOLS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT FOCUS ON PROJECT-LEVEL ECONOMIC AND ENGINEERING EFFICIENCY AND RARELY CONSIDER REGION-LEVEL ENVIRONMENT AND EQUITY. THEREFORE, THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO CREATE A GIS-BASED DECISION SYSTEM TO INTEGRATE REGIONAL ECONOMIC/ENGINEERING EFFICIENCY, ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, AND SOCIAL EQUITY INTO EV CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING AND DESIGN. BUILT UPON PRELIMINARY DATA ON ENGINEERING-FOCUSED OPTIMIZATION MODELS FOR CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION, THIS PROJECT WILL FURTHER (1) ASSESS REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS, (2) ASSESS REGIONAL SOCIAL EQUITY, AND (3) IDENTIFY URBAN-RURAL SPATIAL MISMATCHES VIA CASE STUDIES IN REAL-WORLD TESTBED REGIONS IN THE U.S. AND CHINA. THE PROJECT WILL PRODUCE CASE STUDIES TO DEMONSTRATE THE USE OF A DECISION SYSTEM AND THE IMPACTS OF EV CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE ON REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT. THE PROJECT WILL PRODUCE NEW KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF EV CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE ON REGION-LEVEL ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND SOCIETAL DEVELOPMENT, AND WILL CREATE A DECISION SYSTEM THAT CAN ASSESS INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT PLANS TO ENSURE ECONOMIC AND ENGINEERING EFFICIENCY, ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, AND SOCIAL EQUITY FOR REGIONAL URBAN-RURAL SYSTEMS. IN PRIOR WORK, THE RESEARCH TEAM DEVELOPED OPTIMIZATION MODELS TO GUIDE THE DESIGN OF EV CHARGING STATIONS (E.G., PRODUCING LOCATIONS AND CONSTRUCTION PLAN). THE OPTIMIZATION MODELS ARE TO MAXIMIZE ECONOMIC COST/BENEFIT BASED ON ENGINEERING SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION. ALSO, THE TEAM DEVELOPED THE GIS-BASED MICHIGAN SPATIAL MISMATCH (MSM) TOOL TO VISUALIZE SPATIAL MISMATCHES AND ISSUES OF REGIONAL EQUITY. TO EXTEND THE MSM ECONOMIC/ENGINEERING-BASED DECISION MODEL (MODULE #1), THIS PROJECT WILL ADD MODULES THAT ASSESS REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY (MODULE #2) AND SOCIAL EQUITY (MODULE #3). MODULES #1-3 TOGETHER WILL CONSTITUTE THE DECISION SYSTEM. TO CREATE THE DECISION SYSTEM, THE RESEARCH TEAM WILL PERFORM TASKS 1-3 AS FOLLOWS. TASK 1: ASSESS REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY TO BE ENABLED BY EV CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. TASK 2: ASSESS THE REGIONAL SOCIAL EQUITY TO BE IMPACTED BY EV CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. TASK 3: DEMONSTRATE THE DECISION SYSTEM TO SUPPORT EV CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE DESIGN. THE DECISION SYSTEM WILL (1) ENABLE BIG DATA ANALYTICS AND INTERACTIVE GRAPHICS TO VISUALIZE REGIONAL CONSISTENCY AND MISMATCHES, (2) ADD LAYERS OF ENVIRONMENT AND EQUITY TO COMPLEMENT CURRENT MODELS AND TOOLS FOR CHARGING STATION OPTIMIZATION, AND (3) HIGHLIGHT REGIONAL INTERACTIONS AND URBAN-RURAL TYPOLOGY THAT IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR FOR EV CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT.

A KEY MOTIVATOR BEHIND THESE ADVANCES IS TO ENHANCE THE SUPPORT FOR EDGE APPLICATIONS, ESPECIALLY VIDEO ANALYSIS (VA). YET VA APPLICATIONS ARE CURRENTLY NOT STRUCTURED TO FULLY LEVERAGE THOSE ADVANCES. A PRIMARY ISSUE IS THE LACK OF STRUCTURED FRAMEWORKS TO DEVELOP AND RUN VA APPLICATIONS, WHICH IN TURN PREVENTS THE DEPLOYMENT AND OPTIMIZATIONS REQUIRED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL THAT CELLULAR NETWORKS (AND THEIR EDGE-CLOUD HIERARCHIES) HAVE TO OFFER. TO TACKLE THIS LIMITATION, THE PROPOSED WORK ADVOCATES FOR A RE-DESIGNED VA SOFTWARE STACK THAT EXPLICITLY TIES VA OPERATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS TO THE RESOURCES, INTERFACES, AND VANTAGE POINTS THAT EACH PLATFORM ELEMENT IN A MOBILE EDGE-CLOUD HIERARCHY BRINGS. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, THE PROJECT TAKES A BOTTOM-UP, THREE-PRONGED APPROACH THAT INVOLVES (1) DEVELOPING A NEW OBJECT-ORIENTED QUERY LANGUAGE FOR VA APPLICATIONS THAT MAKES THE AFOREMENTIONED CHARACTERISTICS EXPLICIT AND OBSERVABLE, (2) LEVERAGING THOSE FEATURES TO DEVELOP A SUITE OF RESOURCE-AWARE OPTIMIZATIONS TO VA COMPUTATIONS THAT CAN OPERATE UNDER DIVERSE (AND RESTRICTED) EDGE CONSTRAINTS, AND (3) DESIGNING A NOVEL TASK PLACEMENT ENGINE THAT AUTOMATICALLY ADAPTS AND OPERATES VA APPLICATIONS ACROSS EDGE-CLOUD HIERARCHIES. OWING TO THE WIDESPREAD USE OF VA APPLICATIONS IN SECTORS SPANNING TRAFFIC CONTROL, TO AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES, TO DISASTER RELIEF, THE PROPOSED RESEARCH PROMISES BENEFITS TO A LARGE PART OF THE POPULATION. THE KEY IMPROVEMENTS WILL COME ALONG TWO AXES ? (1) REPLACING PAINSTAKING MANUAL ANALYSIS WITH AUTOMATIC DETERMINATION OF THE APPROPRIATE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN VA APPLICATIONS AND EMERGING MOBILE NETWORKING INFRASTRUCTURE, AND (2) DEMOCRATIZING THE USE OF EDGE NETWORKING INFRASTRUCTURE ? AND WILL TARGET TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS. ON THE ONE HAND, THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORKS WILL SIMPLIFY THE CREATION OF CUTTING-EDGE VA APPLICATIONS FOR DEVELOPERS BY AUTOMATICALLY DECIDING WHAT PUBLIC EDGE INFRASTRUCTURE TO USE AND HOW TO USE IT MOST EFFECTIVELY (IN TERMS OF COST, ACCURACY, AND PERFORMANCE). ON THE OTHER HAND, THE DEVELOPED SYSTEMS WILL ASSIST NETWORK OPERATORS IN IDENTIFYING THE MOST FRUITFUL RESOURCE ENHANCEMENTS AND HELPFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE PLATFORM TO EXPOSE TO APPLICATION ELEMENTS. THE PROJECT ALSO INVOLVES OUTREACH EFFORTS TO ATTRACT STUDENTS FROM POPULATIONS CURRENTLY UNDER-REPRESENTED IN COMPUTER SCIENCE. KEY TO THESE EFFORTS IS MAGNIFYING THE INTERDISCIPLINARY NATURE OF EDGE-BASED VA APPLICATIONS THAT SPAN MOBILE SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, COMPUTER VISION, PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES, AND MACHINE LEARNING.

WHEN THESE GASES ARE SQUEEZED INTO THIN, HORIZONTAL SHEETS THEY CAN BE CONFINED INTO VARIOUS SHAPES WITHIN THE SHEET SUCH AS RINGS AND DISKS. COOLING THESE CONFINED GASES TO NEAR ABSOLUTE ZERO CAN CAUSE THEM TO TRANSITION TO A STATE WHERE THE QUANTUM (I.E. WAVE-LIKE) NATURES OF ALL THE GAS ATOMS LOCK TOGETHER AND BECOME IDENTICAL AND THUS ACT AS ONE. SUCH A STATE IS CALLED A BOSE-EINSTEIN CONDENSATE (BEC) AND A SYSTEM IN THIS STATE CAN DISPLAY ULTRA-SENSITIVITY TO THE ACCELERATION AND ROTATION OF ITS ENVIRONMENT. THIS RESEARCH WILL INVESTIGATE HOW SUCH SYSTEMS, CALLED ATOMTRONIC SYSTEMS, CAN THEREFORE BE USED AS ROTATION AND ACCELERATION SENSORS. IN PARTICULAR THIS WORK WILL INVESTIGATE HOW KEEPING SUCH SYSTEMS AT LOW BUT NON-ZERO TEMPERATURES CAN BE USED TO ENHANCE THEIR PERFORMANCE AS SENSORS. FUNDAMENTAL STUDIES WILL ALSO BE CARRIED OUT TO UNDERSTAND THE THERMODYNAMICS OF THESE GASES AND THIS KNOWLEDGE WILL BE USED TO INFORM THE SENSOR PERFORMANCE STUDIES. THIS WORK WILL BE PERFORMED BY A TEAM OF RESEARCHERS AT GEORGIA SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY AND AT THE JOINT QUANTUM INSTITUTE HOUSED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK. THIS WORK WILL BE PERFORMED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COLDQUANTA, INC. COLDQUANTA PROVIDES COLD-MATTER TECHNOLOGY TO GOVERNMENT AND ACADEMICS. THEY HAVE DONATED TIME ON THEIR ALBERT QUANTUM MATTER MACHINE TO FACILITATE THESE STUDIES. THE SOCIETAL BENEFIT OF THIS WORK WILL BE TO IMPROVE SENSORS FOR PRECISION NAVIGATION APPLICATIONS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO COMMERCIAL TRAVEL AND THE US NATIONAL DEFENSE. THE INTELLECTUAL MERIT OF THIS PROJECT HAS TWO AREAS. IN THE FIRST AREA THE EFFECTS OF FINITE TEMPERATURE ON THE OPERATION OF ATOMTRONIC QUANTUM SENSORS AND INTERFEROMETERS WILL BE STUDIED. ATOMTRONIC PRECISION NAVIGATION IDEAS SUCH AS DOUBLE-RING BECS ACCELEROMETERS, DOUBLE-TARGET BEC ARRAY ROTATION SENSORS, DUAL-SAGNAC ATOM INTERFEROMETER (AI) ROTATION SENSORS, AND LARGE-RING BEC WAVEGUIDES WILL BE INVESTIGATED. SIMULATIONS WILL BE PERFORMED OF THEIR OPERATION WITH A VARIETY OF NON-EQUILIBRIUM FINITE-TEMPERATURE MODELS. THESE MODELS WILL INVESTIGATE HOW THE PRESENCE OF A THERMAL CLOUD MIGHT BE USED TO ENHANCE SENSOR OPERATION. IN THE SECOND AREA FUNDAMENTAL STUDIES OF THE QUANTUM THERMODYNAMICS (QT) OF SYSTEMS IN THE QT SANDBOX WILL BE PERFORMED. THE QT SANDBOX IS A QUASI-2D GAS CONTAINING ONE OR MORE BECS CREATED IN VARIOUS POTENTIALS AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES THAT CAN BE STIRRED, PHASE-IMPRINTED, MOVED INTO AND OUT OF CONTACT, AND PROBED. STUDIES INCLUDE THERMALIZATION OF SHAKEN/STIRRED/PHASE-IMPRINTED FINITE-TEMPERATURE BECS; HOW TO PROBE THERMAL CHARACTERISTICS SYSTEMS BY IMAGING; HOW TO BUILD TRADITIONAL THERMODYNAMIC SYSTEMS SUCH AS HEAT ENGINES AND REFRIGERATORS; HOW ATOMTRONIC THERMOMETERS CAN BE CONSTRUCTED; AND FINALLY THE THERMODYNAMICS OF TRANSPORT OF ATOMTRONIC SYSTEMS. THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO PROVIDE TWO UNDERGRADUATE PHYSICS MAJORS AT GEORGIA SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY WITH RESEARCH EXPERIENCES IN CUTTING-EDGE, ULTRACOLD-ATOM RESEARCH. STUDENTS WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO COLLABORATE WITH SCIENTISTS AT THE JOINT QUANTUM INSTITUTE.

HOWEVER, IN MANY NATURAL PHENOMENA AND TECHNOLOGICAL PROCESSES, PHASE TRANSITIONS OCCUR VERY RAPIDLY. AN IMPORTANT EXAMPLE IS CAVITATION, WHICH IS THE FORMATION OF BUBBLES DUE TO LOW OR EVEN NEGATIVE PRESSURES IN LIQUIDS. CAVITATION STARTS WITH THE NUCLEATION AND RAPID GROWTH OF BUBBLES. THE PROCESS IS DIFFICULT TO CHARACTERIZE IN THREE-DIMENSIONAL SAMPLES BECAUSE IT CAN OCCUR ANYWHERE AND IS COMPLETED IN NANOSECONDS. CLASSICAL NUCLEATION THEORY (CNT) HELPS UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMICS OF NUCLEATION, BUT THERE ARE IMPORTANT CASES WHERE IT FAILS, SUCH AS CAVITATION IN PURE WATER NEAR ROOM TEMPERATURE, WHICH OCCURS AT VERY DIFFERENT PRESSURES THAN THOSE PREDICTED BY CNT. REFINING THEORETICAL MODELS REQUIRES ACCURATE EXPERIMENTAL DATA. FURTHERMORE, DATA UNDER EXTREME CONDITIONS IS IMPORTANT FOR ADDRESSING CAVITATION IN APPLICATIONS SUCH AS MODERN DIESEL ENGINES, WHICH USE HIGH PRESSURE FUEL INJECTION TO ACHIEVE HIGH EFFICIENCY AND LOW EMISSIONS. THIS PROJECT WILL APPLY AND REFINE LASER ABLATION TECHNIQUES TO INDUCE CAVITATION AT LARGE NEGATIVE PRESSURES ON NANOSECOND TIME SCALES, AND ULTRAFAST FLASHES OF LIGHT AND X-RAYS TO CAPTURE THE EVOLUTION OF CAVITATION BUBBLES OVER NANOSECONDS AND AT NANOMETER DIMENSIONS. ADVANCED IMAGE ANALYSIS AND COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS (CFD) SIMULATIONS WILL BE USED TO INCREASE THE ACCURACY OF PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS AT THE INCEPTION OF CAVITATION. THE WORK WILL BE PERFORMED IN UNIVERSITY LABS AND AT X-RAY FREE-ELECTRON LASER (XFEL) FACILITIES AND WILL INVOLVE A COLLABORATION ON CFD SIMULATIONS WITH PROF. DR. NIKOLAUS ADAMS AT THE TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF MUNICH. THE PROJECT WILL TRAIN GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS AND WILL EXPOSE THEM TO UNIVERSITY RESEARCH AND ALSO TO LARGE SCIENCE FACILITIES AND INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIONS. THE PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE CAVITATION IN WATER AND DIESEL FUEL BELOW THE BOILING POINT (COLD CAVITATION) AT TIME AND LENGTH SCALES THAT REPRESENT THE EXPERIMENTAL FRONTIER OF THE FIELD (NANOSECOND AND NANOMETER, OR ?ULTRAFAST?), USING PULSED X-RAY LASER ABLATION AND PULSED OPTICAL ABLATION. THE TECHNIQUES TO INDUCE CAVITATION AT THE NANOSECOND-NANOMETER SCALES HAVE BEEN RECENTLY DEMONSTRATED, BUT THEY MUST BE REFINED, AND HIGH ACCURACY MEASUREMENTS OF CAVITATION PRESSURES AND NUCLEATION RATES ARE NOT YET POSSIBLE. THEREFORE, NEW TECHNIQUES WILL BE DEVELOPED TO CHARACTERIZE THE DYNAMICS OF ULTRAFAST CAVITATION: (1) EXTRACTING DIRECTLY FROM HIGH-ACCURACY OPTICAL IMAGES OF DROPS AND JETS DETAILED HYDRODYNAMIC PARAMETERS, SUCH AS PRESSURE WAVE KINEMATICS AND AMPLITUDE, USING ADVANCED IMAGE ANALYSIS IN COMBINATION WITH IMAGE SIMULATIONS; (2) COMBINING HIGH-ACCURACY IMAGE DATA WITH HIGH-ACCURACY COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS (CFD) SIMULATIONS TO MEASURE VERY HIGH CAVITATION RATES AS A FUNCTION OF PRESSURE; AND (3) IMAGING RAPIDLY EVOLVING NANOBUBBLES USING FEMTOSECOND X-RAY LASER SCATTERING.

THE GAS CORE NUCLEAR REACTOR HAS THE POTENTIAL TO GREATLY REDUCE TRIP TIME TO MARS. OPERATING AT TEMPERATURES MORE THAN 8000 K  SPECIFIC IMPULSE DOUBLE AND TRIPLE A CONVENTIONAL SOLID CORE REACTOR IS POSSIBLE. THE TECHNOLOGY FEATURE HIGH THRUST (KN LEVELS) AND HIGH SPECIFIC IMPULSE (SEVERAL THOUSAND SECONDS). THE CHIEF ISSUES WITH THE GAS CORE REACTOR LIE IN 1) STABILITY OF FISSIONING PLASMA AND 2) URANIUM PLASMA EROSION DUE TO MIXING AND SUBSEQUENT ENTRAINMENT WITH HYDROGEN FUEL. THE CONFINEMENT MUST MINIMIZE FUEL LOSS WHILE ISOLATING THE FUEL FROM THE WALLS. INSTABILITIES SUCH AS RALEIGH TAYLOR CAN ENHANCE MIXING LEADING TO LOSS OF CONFINEMENT. HERE WE INVESTIGATE BOTH CONFINEMENT AND STABILITY OF CONFINEMENT. WE INVESTIGATE INSTABILITIES THAT COULD LEAD TO FUEL EROSION. THE COMPUTATIONAL PLATFORM DEVELOPED HERE WILL ALLOW FOR NOT ONLY STABILITY TO BE INVESTIGATED BUT ALSO HEAT TRANSFER FROM FISSIONING PLASMA TO THE GAS. THIS PROPOSAL RELATES TO THE NASA TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP OF ADVANCED FISSION IN-SPACE PROPULSION TECHNOLOGIES (TABS 2.3.6). THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL ENABLE HUMAN EXPLORATION WELL BEYOND LEO. THIS PROPOSED ACTIVITY AIMS TO COMPUTATIONALLY EXPLORE STABILITY AND HEAT TRANSFER USING A COMBINATION OF COMMERCIAL CODES SUCH AS FLUENT FOR FLOW AND FISSIONING MASS STABILITY (VORTEX STABILIZED) AND MCNP FOR NEUTRONICS AS WELL AS AN ANALYTICAL FORMULATION FOR THE STUDY OF HEAT TRANSFER TO THE GAS. THESE MODELS WILL BE SELF CONSISTENTLY COUPLED AS THE NEUTRONICS IMPACTS URANIUM FUEL TEMPERATURE AND HEAT TRANSFER. INSTABILITIES CAN IMPACT NOT ONLY HEAT TRANSFER BUT ALSO THE NEUTRONICS. THE GOAL IS TO STUDY STABILITY AND FUEL LOSS RATES IN DETAIL. FINDINGS FROM THE MODEL WILL BE VALIDATED USING A SIMPLE EXPERIMENTAL MODEL TAILORED TO MIMIC THE VORTEX STABILIZED URANIUM FUEL. HERE WE HEAT AN ULTRASONICALLY TRAPPED  LOW VAPOR PRESSURE IONIC SALT USING A LASER TO SERVE AS THE SURROGATE URANIUM PLASMA. THE CONFINED HOT DROPLET WILL BE SUBJECTED TO FLOW IN A CHAMBER GEOMETRY DESIGNED TO GENERATE A VORTEX CAVITY AT THE LOCATION OF THE HOT DROPLET. USING PIV AND FAST CAMERA IMAGING WE WILL IMAGE STABILITY OF THE INTERFACE AND DETERMINE CAPILLARY WAVE STRUCTURE AT THE SURFACE. WE WILL ALSO DIRECTLY MEASURE HEAT TRANSFER TO THE ENTRAINING GAS VIA ENTHALPY HEAT PROBES. FINALLY  USING A DIFFERENTIALLY PUMPED VACUUM SYSTEM  WE WILL STUDY MASS LOSS FROM THE DROPLET WITH A RESIDUAL GAS ANALYZER. THE PARAMETER SPACE FOR THIS DROPLET WILL BE MAPPED AND USED TO SERVE AS A TEST CASE DATABASE FOR MODEL VALIDATION. THE FINDINGS WILL BE USED TO NOT ONLY TO REFINE THE MODEL BUT ALSO PHYSICALLY BETTER UNDERSTAND THE STABILITY AND HEAT TRANSFER DYNAMICS OF GEOMETRIES AKIN TO THAT PREVAILING IN GAS CORE REACTORS.

HOWEVER, ALL SYSTEMS USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI), MANY OF WHICH PEOPLE RELY UPON EVERYDAY (E.G., SEARCH ENGINES, NAVIGATION APPS, FRAUD DETECTION, ETC.), NEED DATA TO WORK. THIS PROJECT BALANCES THE COMPETING NEEDS OF OBTAINING DATA TO IMPROVE AI TECHNOLOGIES AND MAXIMIZING THE PRIVACY OF PEOPLE CONTRIBUTING THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO RESEARCH STUDIES. WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE AI RESEARCH COMMUNITY, THIS PROJECT DEVELOPS A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM TO HELP AI RESEARCHERS SECURE DATA COLLECTED ABOUT PEOPLE WHILE AT THE SAME TIME IMPROVING THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE NEW SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES. SPECIFICALLY, THE PROTOTYPE SYSTEM WILL GENERATE PRIVACY-ENHANCED DEMOGRAPHIC QUESTIONS AND SUGGEST DATA COLLECTION PLANS THAT ENSURE DATA COLLECTED ABOUT PEOPLE BALANCES NEEDS FOR STATISTICAL RIGOR AND COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVENESS. IN DOING SO, THIS SYSTEM IMPROVES THE QUALITY, SECURITY, AND EFFICIENCY OF HUMAN-CENTERED AI RESEARCH BY REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF DATA COLLECTED ABOUT PEOPLE AND HELPING TO CREATE AI SYSTEMS THAT ARE USABLE, FAIR, ACCURATE, AND TRUSTWORTHY. DESIGNING HUMAN SUBJECTS STUDIES THAT PRESERVE RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS' PRIVACY AND SECURITY WHILE STILL GENERATING ROBUST RESULTS IS TRICKY. THIS PROJECT LEVERAGES CYBERSECURITY TECHNIQUES SUCH AS DATA-MINIMIZATION TO HELP HUMAN-CENTERED AI RESEARCHERS BETTER PROTECT RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS' PRIVACY WHILE ENSURING THEIR STUDIES' STATISTICAL POWER AND GENERALIZABILITY. IN COLLABORATION WITH THE HUMAN-CENTERED AI RESEARCH COMMUNITY, THIS PROJECT BUILDS A USABLE TOOLCHAIN FOR GENERATING DATA-MINIMIZING DEMOGRAPHIC SURVEY QUESTIONS AND DETERMINING STATISTICALLY WELL-POWERED STUDY SAMPLE SIZE AND DEMOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE COMPOSITION TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF RESEARCH RESULTS.THE SYSTEM MAXIMIZES THE PRIVACY OF HUMAN SUBJECTS AND RECOMMENDS A SAMPLE SIZE AND COMPOSITION WHICH BALANCES STATISTICAL POWER AND REPRESENTATIVENESS. THIS APPROACH PROMOTES THE QUALITY OF SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES AT THE POINT OF STUDY DESIGN.

EACH HAS ITS BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS, BUT COMMON UNDERLYING WEAKNESSES TO THE ADVANCED METHODS ARE LACK OF PRECISION AND NEED FOR READER TRAINING. BY CONTRAST, MOST OF THE 7.7 MILLION AMERICANS WITH VISUAL DISABILITIES ARE AT LEAST MODERATELY SKILLED IN USING A SCREEN READER. HOWEVER, THIS TYPICALLY LIMITS USERS TO SERIAL DATA POINT ACCESS, THE EQUIVALENT OF A DATA TABLE, WHICH DOES NOT PROVIDE AN EQUIVALENT EXPERIENCE TO THE ADVANTAGES OF DATA VISUALIZATIONS. IT DECREASES INDEPENDENCE AND PROFESSIONAL OPPORTUNITIES, INCREASES STRESS, DECREASES QUALITY OF LIFE, AND PUTS VULNERABLE PEOPLE AT RISK WHEN CRUCIAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFORMATION IS DISSEMINATED IN GRAPHICAL-ONLY FORM, SUCH AS IN THE CURRENT COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE LONG RANGE GOAL OF THIS PHASE I PROJECT IS TO CREATE TECHNOLOGIES THAT PERMIT AUTHORS AND DEVELOPERS OF WEB SITES TO EFFORTLESSLY PUBLISH CHARTS, DIAGRAMS, AND INFOGRAPHICS THAT ARE FULLY USABLE BY ALL PEOPLE, IN PARTICULAR PEOPLE WHO ARE BLIND, LOW-VISION, OR HAVE COGNITIVE DISABILITIES. IN THIS PHASE I SBIR PROJECT, WE WILL ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF CREATING INTERACTIVE CONTEXTUAL AUTOMATIC DESCRIPTIONS THAT ENABLE THE READER TO CONSTRUCT AN ACCURATE WORKING MENTAL MODEL OF THE DATA WITH MINIMAL EFFORT AND TIME, TO PERFORM TASKS AND MAKE DECISIONS. FIZZ STUDIO HAS CREATED A SOFTWARE PACKAGE, FIZZ CHARTS, THAT GENERATES ACCESSIBLE KEYBOARD-BROWSABLE CHARTS FOR USE ON ANY WEBSITE. WE SEEK TO ENHANCE THIS WITH FIZZ READER, A NOVEL INTERACTIVE INTERFACE THAT USES NATURAL LANGUAGE GENERATION (NLG) TO ENABLE THE USER TO QUERY THE CHART FOR QUICK ANSWERS ABOUT EACH DATA POINT, ITS RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER DATA POINTS AND TO THE CHART STATISTICS, AND TO HIGH-LEVEL OR DETAILED TRENDS AND PATTERNS IN THE DATA. THE EFFECT IS OF ONE PERSON EXPLAINING THE CHART TO ANOTHER OVER THE PHONE, AND PROVIDING RELEVANT AND RAPID ANSWERS TO HELP THE LISTENER UNDERSTAND AS MUCH OF THE DATA AS THEY WISH FOR A CORE SET OF 7 COMMON CHART TYPES: BAR; LINE; PIE; HISTOGRAM; SCATTERPLOT; HEATMAP; AND FLOWCHART. AIM 1: DEVELOP EFFECTIVE INTERACTIVE NLG MODEL AND ENGINE MODULE TO CONCISELY COMMUNICATE RELEVANT DETAILS TO THE USER, WE WILL DESIGN A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF TASKS FOR ALL SUPPORTED CHART TYPES, AND A SET OF NLG TEMPLATES FOR EACH CHART COMPONENT (E.G. DATA POINT, AXIS, TITLE). WE WILL USE THESE NLG TEMPLATES TO DEVELOP A SOFTWARE MODULE WHICH COMPOSES COLLOQUIAL UTTERANCES FROM AN INTERNAL STATISTICAL DATA MODEL WE BUILD FROM THE DATA EXTRACTED FROM THE CHART. EACH SET OF OPTIONS WILL REPRESENT THE AFFORDANCES OPTIMAL FOR THE CHART TYPE (E.G. COMPARISONS FOR BAR CHARTS, CHANGES OVER TIME FOR LINE CHARTS). THIS MODULE WILL HAVE A CLIENT-SERVER API ARCHITECTURE, TO MAKE IT ADAPTABLE TO MULTIPLE USER INTERFACE MODALITIES, INCLUDING THE SCREEN READER INTERMEDIARY IN AIM 2, AS WELL AS A STANDALONE DIGITAL ASSISTANT OR A COMPONENT IN A SMART SPEAKER. TO ENSURE EFFECTIVENESS AND CLARITY, WE WILL PERFORM MULTI-PHASE TESTING FOR USABILITY AND TASK ACCOMPLISHMENT WITH 10-20 BLIND AND LOW-VISION HUMAN SUBJECTS, AND INTEGRATE THEIR FEEDBACK. WE SEEK 80% SUCCESSFUL TASK ACCOMPLISHMENT ACROSS ALL CHART TYPES AND TASKS. AIM 2: IMPLEMENT A BROWSER-BASED SCREEN READER INTERMEDIARY USER INTERFACE MODULE (UIM) TO INTEGRATE OUR NLG MODULE DIRECTLY INTO THE BROWSER, FOR ON-DEMAND PRESENTATION OF THE GENERATED NLG CHART INFORMATION TO USERS OF SCREEN READERS, WE WILL IMPLEMENT AN OPTION-BASED INTERFACE USING JAVASCRIPT AND ARIA TECHNOLOGIES.

BALLOON-BORNE AND GROUNDBASED EXPERIMENTS ARE POISED TO DISCOVER THESE ULTRA-HIGH ENERGY (UHE) COSMOGENIC NEUTRINOS BY LOOKING FOR RADIO EMISSION FROM TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF NEUTRINO INTERACTIONS: PARTICLE CASCADES INDUCED BY NEUTRINOS IN GLACIAL ICE  AND EXTENSIVE AIR SHOWERS IN THE ATMOSPHERE INDUCED BY THE CHARGED-PARTICLE BY-PRODUCT OF TAU NEUTRINOS INTERACTING IN THE EARTH. THESE IMPULSIVE RADIO DETECTORS ARE ALSO SENSITIVE TO RADIO EMISSION FROM EXTENSIVE AIR SHOWERS INDUCED DIRECTLY BY UHE COSMIC RAYS. BALLOON-BORNE EXPERIMENTS ARE ESPECIALLY WELL-SUITED FOR DISCOVERING THE HIGHEST ENERGY NEUTRINOS  AND ARE THE ONLY WAY TO PROBE THE HIGH ENERGY CUTOFF OF THE SOURCES THEMSELVES TO REVEAL THE ASTROPHYSICS THAT DRIVES THE CENTRAL ENGINES INSIDE THE MOST ENERGETIC ACCELERATORS IN THE UNIVERSE. BALLOON PLATFORMS OFFER THE CHANCE TO MONITOR EXTREMELY LARGE VOLUMES OF ICE AND ATMOSPHERE. THE ANTARCTIC IMPULSIVE TRANSIENT ANTENNA (ANITA) AND THE EXAVOLT ANTENNA CONCEPT BOTH LEVERAGE THIS PLATFORM AND ARE OPTIMIZED FOR DISCOVERY OF THE HIGHEST ENERGY NEUTRINOS. WE ARE DEVELOPING AN INTERFEROMETRIC PHASED ARRAY TRIGGER FOR THESE IMPULSIVE RADIO DETECTORS  A NEW TYPE OF TRIGGER THAT WILL IMPROVE SENSITIVITY SUBSTANTIALLY AND EXPEDITE THE DISCOVERY OF THE HIGHEST ENERGY PARTICLES IN OUR UNIVERSE. WE HAVE DEVELOPED AN 8-CHANNEL INTERFEROMETRIC TRIGGER BOARD FOR GROUND-BASED APPLICATIONS THAT WAS DEPLOYED IN DECEMBER 2017 WITH THE GROUND-BASED ASKARYAN RADIO ARRAY (ARA) EXPERIMENT AT THE SOUTH POLE  AND IS CURRENTLY WORKING AS DESIGNED. PRELIMINARY MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS INDICATE THAT THE COSMOGENIC NEUTRINO EVENT RATE WILL GO UP BY A FACTOR OF ~3 WITH THE NEW TRIGGER. THE TRUE POWER OF THE INTERFEROMETRIC TRIGGER IS IN SCALING TO LARGE NUMBERS OF CHANNELS  AND THE DISCOVERY SPACE THAT IS ONLY AVAILABLE FROM A BALLOON PLATFORM AT THE HIGHEST ENERGIES IS EXTREMELY APPEALING. UNDER THE APRA FUNDED IN ASSOCIATION WITH THIS ROMAN TECHNOLOGY FELLOWSHIP (RTF) PROPOSAL  WE WILL BUILD ON AND EXTEND THE NASA INVESTMENT IN THE ANITA LONG DURATION BALLOON (LDB) MISSION AND THE MANY OTHER COMPLEMENTARY PARTICLE ASTROPHYSICS LDB MISSIONS BY DEVELOPING THE ELECTRONICS REQUIRED TO BRING A LARGE-SCALE RADIO INTERFEROMETRIC TRIGGER TO A BALLOON PLATFORM  EXTENDING THE SCIENTIFIC REACH OF ANY FUTURE LDB OR SUPER PRESSURE BALLOON (SPB) MISSION FOR RADIO DETECTION OF THE HIGHEST ENERGY COSMIC PARTICLES. WE WILL DEVELOP AN INTERFEROMETRIC TRIGGER SYSTEM THAT IS SCALABLE TO O(100) CHANNELS AND SUITABLE FOR USE ON A BALLOON PLATFORM. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL  WHICH BUILDS ON THE FUNDED APRA THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS RTF REQUEST  WE WILL POSITION THE VIEREGG GROUP AT UCHICAGO TO BE A LEADER IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF FAST RADIO DETECTORS DESIGNED FOR DISCOVERING UHE COSMIC PARTICLES  WITH AN EYE TOWARD BECOMING THE PI OF A BALLOON MISSION IN THE NEXT 3 YEARS. WE WILL: 1) PURCHASE A FREEZER LARGE ENOUGH TO TEST THE PHASED ARRAY INSTRUMENTATION THAT WE ARE BUILDING FOR BALLOON-BORNE AND GROUND-BASED APPLICATIONS AND PURCHASE TEST EQUIPMENT REQUIRED TO DEVELOP RADIO FREQUENCY ELECTRONICS. 2) DESIGN ANTENNAS AND A FRONT-END AMPLIFICATION AND FILTERING SYSTEM THAT WILL BE REQUIRED TO TURN THE O(100) CHANNEL TRIGGER AND DATA ACQUISITION ELECTRONICS THAT ARE FUNDED UNDER THE ASSOCIATED APRA AWARD INTO A FULL BALLOON CONCEPT AND PROPOSAL. 3) CONTINUE TO DEVELOP MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL EXPERIMENTAL CONFIGURATION THAT LEVERAGES THE NEW PHASED ARRAY TECHNOLOGY.,NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,O,PRIVATE INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_80NSSC19K0298_8000/,2021-03-22 16:03:20.051393+00

BUILDING ON THE NSF CIF21 VISION, THE EARTHCUBE PROGRAM WAS FORMED TO ADDRESS THE TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGES SURROUNDING DATA AND SOFTWARE WITHIN THE GEOSCIENCES. THROUGH EXTENSIVE INTERACTION WITH THE COMMUNITY THIS CULMINATED IN TWO KEY ACTIVITIES AROUND DATA DISCOVERY AND REUSE. FIRST, THE PROMOTION, REFINEMENT, AND ADOPTION OF SCHEMA.ORG TO ANNOTATE GEOSCIENCES METADATA WITHIN DISTRIBUTED REPOSITORIES SO THAT DATASETS CAN BE CRAWLED. SECOND, THE PROMOTION AND SUPPORT FOR THE ADOPTION OF NOTEBOOKS TO DOCUMENT, SHARE, AND REUSE SOFTWARE AS PEER REVIEWED SCHOLARLY OBJECTS.

WITH BREAKTHROUGHS IN EXPERIMENTAL TECHNOLOGY, HIGH-QUALITY DATA CAN NOW BE OBTAINED FOR COMPLEX SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING PROBLEMS. HOWEVER, THE GENERATION OF SUCH HIGH-QUALITY DATA ENTAILS LARGE EXPERIMENTAL AND COMPUTATIONAL COSTS, RESULTING IN LIMITED DATA FOR SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION. WHILE PREDICTIVE MODELING PROVIDES SOME RELIEF, RECENT WORK HAS REVEALED TWO KEY SHORTCOMINGS WITH EXISTING MODELS: THEY OFTEN YIELD POOR PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE WHEN TRAINED WITH LIMITED DATA, AND CAN VIOLATE ESTABLISHED SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES, WHICH MAY LEAD TO ERRONEOUS AND SPURIOUS SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS. THIS PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A NOVEL SCIENCE-INTEGRATED PREDICTIVE MODELING (SCINPL) FRAMEWORK WHICH ADDRESSES THESE LIMITATIONS. SCINPL PAVES THE ROAD FOR TRANSFORMATIVE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, EQUIPPING PRACTITIONERS WITH ACCURATE, COST-EFFICIENT AND INTERPRETABLE PREDICTIVE MODELS FOR GUIDING SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS. THIS FRAMEWORK CAN CATALYZE CLOSER COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN THE SCIENTIFIC AND DATA SCIENCE COMMUNITIES, BY DEMONSTRATING THE PRACTICAL ADVANTAGES OF SCIENCE-DRIVEN STATISTICAL LEARNING AND DATA-DRIVEN SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY. SCINPL PROVIDES A RADICAL PARADIGM SHIFT FOR SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY IN A BROAD RANGE OF FIELDS, ENABLING SCIENTISTS TO PUSH FORWARD THE FRONTIERS OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND ENGINEERING VIA IMPROVED SCIENCE-BASED DATA SCIENCE TOOLS. SCINPL FEATURES A SUITE OF NEW PROBABILISTIC BAYESIAN MODELS, WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF INTEGRATING A WIDE RANGE OF PRIOR SCIENTIFIC DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE AS PRIOR BELIEFS FOR PREDICTIVE MODELING. THIS INTEGRATION OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE WITH DATA-DRIVEN MODELS NOT ONLY PROVIDES IMPROVED PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE WITH REDUCED UNCERTAINTY, BUT ALSO ENABLES BETTER INTERPRETABILITY AND THUS SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY GIVEN LIMITED TRAINING DATA. THE FIRST MODEL, CALLED THE BOUNDARY-CONSTRAINED GP MODEL, INTEGRATES KNOWN BOUNDARY INFORMATION FOR THE RESPONSE SURFACE WITHIN A GAUSSIAN PROCESS (GP) FRAMEWORK. THE SECOND MODEL, THE GRAPHICAL MULTI-FIDELITY GP MODEL, EMBEDS DEPENDENCY INFORMATION BETWEEN SCIENTIFIC MODELS FOR PREDICTIVE MODELING. THE THIRD MODEL, THE GAUSSIAN PROCESS SUBSPACE REGRESSION MODEL, INTEGRATES SUBSPACE INFORMATION REPRESENTING DOMINANT PHYSICS FOR GP MODELING. FOR EACH MODEL, THE INVESTIGATORS WILL (I) ESTABLISH A SOLID THEORETICAL FOUNDATION FOR PREDICTIVE MODELING, WHICH DEMONSTRATES THE IMPROVED PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE VIA THE INTEGRATION OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION, (II) PRESENT A COMPREHENSIVE METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK AND EFFICIENT SUITE OF ALGORITHMS FOR PERFORMING THIS DESIRED INTEGRATION OF SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES WITHIN PROBABILISTIC MODELING, AND (III) DEMONSTRATE THE USEFULNESS OF SUCH MODELS FOR COST-EFFICIENT, INTERPRETABLE AND PRINCIPLED SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY. MAJOR EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON DEMONSTRATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SCINPL IN TACKLING A BROAD RANGE OF COMPLEX AND EXPENSIVE SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS, INCLUDING THE DESIGN OF 3D-PRINTED AORTIC VALVES, THE STUDY OF HEAVY-ION COLLISIONS, AND THE OPTIMIZATION OF ROCKET ENGINES FOR SPACEFLIGHT.

MANY CERAMICS ARE COMPOSED OF MICROSCOPIC FEATURES KNOWN AS GRAINS. THE SIZE OF THESE GRAINS DICTATES MANY MATERIAL PROPERTIES, INCLUDING CRACK RESISTANCE. A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE TO FABRICATING RELIABLE CERAMIC PARTS IS THE ABILITY TO CONTROL THE GRAIN SIZE, BECAUSE GRAINS GROW UNPREDICTABLY AT THE HIGH TEMPERATURES NEEDED FOR PROCESSING. THE GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO UNCOVER THE UNDERLYING MECHANISM FOR GRAIN GROWTH IN CERAMIC MATERIALS TO GUIDE NEW PROCESSING METHODS FOR OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL, THIS PROGRAM TRAINS THE NEXT GENERATION OF CERAMIC ENGINEERS IN THE NECESSARY SKILLS FOR ADVANCED MATERIAL PROCESSING. ADDITIONALLY, THIS PROGRAM?S EDUCATIONAL GOAL IS TO BUILD A CREATIVE AND MULTI-DISCIPLINARY WORKFORCE BY ENGAGING PRE-COLLEGIATE ART STUDENTS IN ACTIVITIES THAT DEMONSTRATE THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN ARTISTIC AND SCIENTIFIC PROCESSES. TO SUPPORT THIS EFFORT, A CERAMIC-PROCESSING KIT IS BEING DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED IN K-12 SCHOOLS. TECHNICAL SUMMARY THE GOAL OF THIS CAREER PROGRAM IS TO ESTABLISH A MECHANISTIC APPROACH THAT LEVERAGES ANISOTROPIC GRAIN BOUNDARY MOTION TO ADVANCE MICROSTRUCTURE DESIGN. DISCONTINUOUS CHANGES IN MOBILITY DUE TO GRAIN BOUNDARY RESTRUCTURING HAVE BEEN HYPOTHESIZED AS THE CAUSE OF IRREGULAR GRAIN GROWTH IN CERAMICS. HOWEVER, THIS RESTRUCTURING INVOLVES A CHANGE IN ENERGY, CONFLATING THE THERMODYNAMIC AND KINETIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO GRAIN BOUNDARY MOTION. WITHOUT THIS INSIGHT INTO GRAIN BOUNDARY MOTION MECHANISMS, PROCESSING OPTIMIZATION RELIES ON HEURISTIC, INEFFICIENT TESTING, WHICH INHIBITS MICROSTRUCTURE DESIGNS. THE EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH IN THIS CAREER PROGRAM UNAMBIGUOUSLY DECONVOLUTES THE THERMODYNAMIC AND KINETIC CONTRIBUTIONS OF GRAIN BOUNDARY MOTION BY MEASURING THE MOBILITY OF FLAT GRAIN BOUNDARIES WITH A CONTROLLED DRIVING FORCE: ENERGY FROM AN APPLIED MAGNETIC FIELD. THE IMPACT OF THIS ANISOTROPIC MOBILITY ON MICROSTRUCTURE EVOLUTION IS ELUCIDATED THROUGH GRAIN GROWTH STUDIES USING NEW, NON-DESTRUCTIVE X-RAY DIFFRACTION MICROSCOPY. WITH THIS MECHANISTIC-INSIGHT, A NEW PROCESSING FRAMEWORK CAN BE DESIGNED FOR MODIFYING GRAIN BOUNDARIES TO DESIGN MICROSTRUCTURES WITH ADVANCED PERFORMANCE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CREATIVE, MULTI-DISCIPLINARY WORKFORCE IS CRITICAL TO IMPLEMENTING SUCH A PROCESSING-FRAMEWORK. THEREFORE, THIS PROGRAM ENCOMPASSES AN EDUCATIONAL PLAN THAT COMBINES ARTISTIC AND SCIENTIFIC METHODOLOGIES IN PRECOLLEGIATE ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING A MULTIDISCIPLINARY CERAMIC KIT FOR DISTRIBUTION IN K-12 SCHOOLS. ADDITIONALLY, ENGINEERING STUDENTS ARE TRAINED IN CERAMIC PROCESSING AND CHARACTERIZATION SKILLS NECESSARY TO ADVANCE MATERIALS PROCESSING.

IN LAKES AND RESERVOIRS  WATER CLARITY PROVIDES A ROBUST METRIC OF ECOSYSTEM HEALTH BY INTEGRATING SURROUNDING TERRESTRIAL AND ATMOSPHERIC CHANGES. IMPAIRED WATER CLARITY DECREASES EPILIMNION DEPTH AND RESTRICTS LIGHT AVAILABILITY FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS BY SUBMERGED MACROPHYTES AND OTHER PRIMARY PRODUCERS. THIS ALTERATION OF LACUSTRINE SYSTEMS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE BIODIVERSITY AND LAKE METABOLISM WITH STRONG IMPLICATIONS FOR INLAND WATER CARBON CYCLING. WHILE THE DRIVERS OF WATER CLARITY FUNCTION AT REGIONAL AND CONTINENTAL SCALES  TRADITIONAL METHODS OF IN SITU MEASUREMENT ARE SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY RESTRICTED TO LOCAL ENVIRONMENTS. RECENT ADVANCES IN REMOTE SENSING TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS ARE INCREASING THE FEASIBILITY OF CONDUCTING SUCH MEASUREMENTS OVER LARGE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DOMAINS. THE NATIONAL WATER QUALITY PORTAL (WQP) AND THE LAKE MULTI-SCALED GEOSPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DATABASE (LAGOS-NE) ARE TWO RECENT DATABASES THAT HAVE COMPILED AND STANDARDIZED WATER QUALITY FIELD MEASUREMENTS FROM THOUSANDS OF GOVERNMENTAL  ACADEMIC  AND NON-PROFIT INSTITUTIONS. IN TOTAL  THE TWO DATABASES HAVE ASSIMILATED MORE THAN 3.6 MILLION HISTORIC WATER CLARITY MEASUREMENTS DISTRIBUTED ACROSS 62 000 UNIQUE SITES. A DATASET OF THIS SIZE AND SPATIAL COVERAGE CREATES NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR REMOTE SENSING MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION.
